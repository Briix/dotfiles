2015-02-04 15:28:27	mwhooker	poettering great, thanks so much for the help
2015-02-04 15:28:27	poettering	eto: well, /dev/log is just one kind of logging
2015-02-04 15:28:27	poettering	eto: there's native journal logging
2015-02-04 15:28:27	poettering	eto: or logging to stdout/stderr
2015-02-04 15:28:27	poettering	eto: or even logging to kmsg from usersapce
2015-02-04 15:28:27	poettering	eto: just bind mounting /dev/log will not be useful to handle all this
2015-02-04 15:28:27	poettering	eto: in general we try to centralize logging at one place, in the journal, and other code then can hook into that, to pass this data on to some other places

2015-02-04 17:36:52	richard_maw	I'm looking at doing Atomic Updates without rebooting. I spoke at FOSDEM (http://richard.maw.name/blog/posts/2015-02-04-live-atomic-updates is my write-up for those interested) about approaches for doing it. The way I'm currently thinking about solving it is to extend switch-root to have a mode for leaving existing services running, and gracefully restart them with socket activation like journald.

2015-02-04 17:37:46	richard_maw	So systemd pivots into the new version of the system, and services are gradually migrated over by passing their fds to systemd while they restart
2015-02-04 17:38:03	richard_maw	Does this sound completely insane?
2015-02-04 17:38:43	richard_maw	I haven't been able to read enough about how systemd works to know whether it will go crazy if it pivots while leaving processes around
2015-02-04 17:40:52	richard_maw	This was why I asked poettering about journald's graceful restart at FOSDEM.

2015-02-04 20:34:46	rudi_s	Hi. Is pulseaudio required for the "take device away and pause sound while switching to another tty" feature of logind? I'm using ALSA on one system and there the switch doesn't pause playing audio, on another with pulseaudio it does.
2015-02-04 20:34:50	rudi_s	I've checked the source of logind to figure out how logind "takes the device" from the process, but couldn't find anything which would be used for sound devices.

2015-02-04 22:25:27	cmtm	I had a question about tmpfiles. Is it okay to create directory using a tmpfiles.d conf file inside of a tmpfs file system that's mounted with a .mount unit file? If so, how is the ordering handled. I thought that tmpfiles.d/*.conf directories were made before mount units were handled
2015-02-04 22:26:17	grawity	well, /tmp itself is handled by tmp.mount

2015-02-04 22:27:23	grawity	systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service is ordered Before=sysinit.target, but After=local-fs.target, so still after all non-network filesystems are mounted
2015-02-04 22:29:13	cmtm	right. if you look at tmpfiles.d/x11.conf, you can see that it makes directories inside of /tmp
2015-02-04 22:30:02	cmtm	wouldn't these directories be made before the tmpfs is mounted?
2015-02-04 22:30:31	grawity	no, like I just said, the service that processes tmpfiles.d is ordered after local-fs.target
2015-02-04 22:30:45	grawity	[...and all .mount units are implicitly ordered before it, AFAIK]
2015-02-04 22:31:55	cmtm	oh right!

2015-02-04 22:33:33	cmtm	so it's my understanding that you can't create the empty /tmp directory through tmpfiles since the tmpfs filesystem is mounted before systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service runs

2015-02-04 22:39:32	cmtm	but that can't create it because it's run after the mounting occurs
2015-02-04 22:40:08	cmtm	ah, so when you specify "Where" in the mount file, does sytemd create the mountpoint if that directory doesn't exist?
2015-02-04 22:40:15	grawity	yes, just like systemd.mount(5) says under "Where="

2015-02-05 14:41:49	dereks	well, let's depend upon time-sync.target :)
2015-02-05 14:42:54	sztanpet	time-sync.target does not signal that time changed at all
2015-02-05 14:43:20	sztanpet	it simply pulls in the services responsible for syncing time, so ntp or systemd-timesycnd or others
2015-02-05 14:43:26	damjan	All services where correct time is essential should be ordered after this unit
2015-02-05 14:43:41	damjan	I guess that's what dereks needs

2015-02-05 14:46:20	dereks	another question, does time-sync.target starts any time sync daemon, like ntpd or timesyncd ?
2015-02-05 14:46:25	damjan	well it says "All services where correct time is essential should be ordered after this unit, but not pull it in."
2015-02-05 14:46:32	damjan	"but not pull it in" 
2015-02-05 14:46:42	damjan	that means no Wants= and Requires= ?
2015-02-05 14:47:01	dereks	I saw that, but I don't know what "pull it in" means
2015-02-05 14:47:34	sztanpet	systemd runs the least amount of services possible, meaning if something is not required and not enabled, it will not be run
2015-02-05 14:47:51	sztanpet	so you have to pull in services you need
2015-02-05 14:48:11	dereks	I actually start ntpd by hand in a service
2015-02-05 14:48:37	yoshuawuyts1	wasn't there a thing where you have to start and stop services manually before they can be discovered?

2015-02-05 14:50:34	sztanpet	if you start it "by hand" that doesnt happen, so the target will never be run or wont do what you want
2015-02-05 14:51:04	dereks	by "by hand" I meant systemctl start ntpd --no-block
2015-02-05 14:51:15	dereks	this should pull in the time-sync.target ?
2015-02-05 14:51:29	damjan	systemctl cat ntpd
2015-02-05 14:51:52	dereks	not really
2015-02-05 14:51:53	sztanpet	that sounds worse since services in the given transaction will simply skip the target and never be called
2015-02-05 14:52:45	sztanpet	it might work if after starting ntpd in that way, you also start your own service
2015-02-05 14:53:06	sztanpet	but we are in the hacks-on-hacks category
2015-02-05 14:53:06	dereks	yeah, that's what happens
2015-02-05 14:53:18	sztanpet	so fix your shit
2015-02-05 14:53:25	dereks	but my own service doesn't depend upon time-sync.target
2015-02-05 14:53:46	dereks	actually systemd-timesyncd does, should I use it instead?

2015-02-05 15:45:58	sztanpet	why do you think it matters that timesyncd first sets the clock to the last sync time?
2015-02-05 15:46:22	sztanpet	provided that the current time is in the past compared to the saved time
2015-02-05 15:46:26	samael	sztanpet: of course i can, but i would like to know if there is a way to do that with timesyncd
2015-02-05 15:46:30	grawity	samael: or you could disable timesyncd
2015-02-05 15:46:34	sztanpet	no
2015-02-05 15:47:19	samael	ok, i indeed need ntpd then. thanks
2015-02-05 15:47:21	grawity	afaik, it only increments the clock, so if there's no NTP but a working RTC, it shouldn't restore the wrong time.anyway?
2015-02-05 15:47:45	sztanpet	ye
2015-02-05 15:47:50	grawity	still trying to understand your situation here
2015-02-05 15:48:24	grawity	such settings do get added if someone needs them for some reason
2015-02-05 15:48:35	grawity	but that reason needs to be known first

2015-02-05 15:50:48	samael	i have devices with no rtc, logging data (among other things). they can loose power and can be restarted with no network for undefined time. i need the entries logged in the meantime to be addressed easily. until now i knew they get dated 1/1/1970, but if they comes up referenced as e.g. 10 hours ago it's a bit mess to manage them

2015-02-05 15:54:51	sztanpet	sounds like a sane enough reason
2015-02-05 15:55:50	damjan	I was thinking of a similar issue, haven't implemented it yet, but my idea was to collect the data with jiffies and then back-date it to proper timestamps once I can publish the data
2015-02-05 15:56:40	samael	i have no problems in reverting back to ntp, but most times i use beaglebone black devices, which come with debian/systemd by default, so leaving timesyncd would be best for me
2015-02-05 15:56:57	grawity	as a hack, remove the stored time file in ExecStartPre=
2015-02-05 15:57:45	grawity	for a timesync.conf option, if IRC forgets it, try asking the mailing list

2015-02-06 01:37:39	tibbs|w	Is it possible to tell systemd to use whichever of multiple pid files exist?
2015-02-06 01:37:44	tibbs|w	I know that's a long shot.
2015-02-06 01:38:27	tibbs|w	I have a daemon that changed the default location of the pid file.  So if you start it from a fresh installation, the pid file will be in a different place than if you start it from an existing installation.
2015-02-06 01:38:43	tibbs|w	And, yes, I'm getting it patched so that it doesn't background itself.
2015-02-06 01:39:18	vovcia	tibbs|w: hmm i dont think systemd use pid files
2015-02-06 01:39:48	tibbs|w	Type=forking PIDFile=/run/whatever
2015-02-06 01:40:01	tibbs|w	Yes, Type=simple would be much better.
2015-02-06 01:40:56	vovcia	oh :/ tibbs|w maybe some kind of fghack would work?

2015-02-09 11:44:59	olahaye74	Hi there.
2015-02-09 11:45:21	olahaye74	I need to write a service that uses ConditionKernelCommandLine=
2015-02-09 11:46:01	olahaye74	and I want to check that kernel cmd line is: MONITOR_CONSOLE=y or MONITOR_CONSOLE=yes or MONITOR_CONSOLE=1
2015-02-09 11:46:11	olahaye74	is ther a way to achieve this?
2015-02-09 11:48:13	olahaye74	(Im' systemImager developper and would like  to stay compatible with non systemd initrd). Otherwize I would have adopted the monitor_console / no_monitor_console keyword

2015-02-09 11:52:47	olahaye74	no pipe on foo?
2015-02-09 11:52:58	grawity	not needed

2015-02-09 11:53:14	grawity	yeah
2015-02-09 11:53:26	olahaye74	cool thx :-)
2015-02-09 11:53:33	grawity	hmm, actually let me check
2015-02-09 11:53:41	olahaye74	I know it's ugly, but I need to keep compatibility with the old systemimager...
2015-02-09 11:53:53	grawity	this is supposed to be documented in systemd.unit(5), but the "triggering condition" stuff is confusing
2015-02-09 11:53:57	olahaye74	I'll add 4th with more modern syntax

2015-02-09 15:41:45	temoto	Unfortunately, this machine runs CoreOS without firewalld. So I guess I have to stick to .service.

2015-02-09 21:35:22	dreisner	if you installed systemd-git into the chroot, then what else is there to do?
2015-02-09 21:35:34	dreisner	update the initramfs maybe?
2015-02-09 21:36:22	demarchi	dreisner: I mean... just build and install with DESTDIR=where-my-container-dir-is

2015-02-09 21:37:07	thrice	demarchi: why not systemd-git and use pacman to install it?
2015-02-09 21:37:09	demarchi	dreisner: i remember testing last week and it doesn't boot. looking at the PKGBUILD it seems there are lots of different configurations

2015-02-09 21:38:32	dreisner	the differences in ./configure flags between the two packages shouldn't be meaningful.
2015-02-09 21:38:56	demarchi	thrice: because it's more convenient to compile/test-run from inside my systemd-git checkout instead of from package's
2015-02-09 21:39:21	dreisner	oh. you aren't even using the PKGBUILD
2015-02-09 21:39:26	dreisner	you're on your own ;)
2015-02-09 21:39:43	demarchi	humn... ok, so how exactly do you do?
2015-02-09 21:39:52	dreisner	i use the PKGBUILD

2015-02-10 13:38:32	coling	It's really weird. I have an nss_ lib that resolves *.dev to localhost (used for hacking on websites for work). In firefox this works fine. In chrome it never loads and it just sits there spinning. If I add the website in question to /etc/hosts, chrome works fine, so it must be my nss library that's borked. But I can't see anything obvious in the calls. I must have cocked up part of the library that it

2015-02-10 20:44:12	sztanpet	you applied it to linux-next?

2015-02-11 00:33:20	TheoMurpse	If I have a python script with a --daemon flag that will control whether the script runs as a regular program or becomes a daemon, but now I want to make it something loaded with systemd, should I have ExecStart=python2 /path/to/file.py --daemon, or should I just do ExecStart=python2 /path/to/file.py ?
2015-02-11 00:36:12	eliasp	TheoMurpse: generally it's better not to deamonize
2015-02-11 00:36:39	TheoMurpse	OK cool, so basically systemd will daemonize it and dump its normal output to /dev/null or something and run it as the user I specify in User=<user>, right?
