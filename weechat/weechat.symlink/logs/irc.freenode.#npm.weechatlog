2015-01-30 11:54:44	yoshuawuyts	Yesterday I reported something about my local dependencies not installing. Found the root of the cause: apparently npm couldn't process one of my packages. JSON was fine though, but might be worth noting that there are some issues with local deps. (:

2015-01-30 17:46:17	Aria	Yeah, shrinkwrap is a bit neglected in the npm@2 codebase. Nominally working for common cases, but inefficient then.
2015-01-30 17:46:33	Aria	The multi-stage install project should make them much better supported.

2015-01-30 17:53:08	Aria	I'm not on the team -- that's iarna and othiym23 -- but it's pretty current work.

2015-02-02 10:26:32	Havvy	Does `npm install --save` work?
2015-02-02 10:26:45	Havvy	If not, check your versions in `npm ls`.
2015-02-02 10:28:06	masan	npm install --save does not work.
2015-02-02 10:28:22	masan	You mean, i have to manually check the version and update in package.json
2015-02-02 10:28:51	Havvy	Possibly `npm install --save package-name` will overwrite for each package.
2015-02-02 10:29:00	Havvy	But round trips through the server.

2015-02-02 10:32:04	Havvy	But only because I can put them side by side.
2015-02-02 10:34:09	masan	how `npm ls` helps here? anyway i have manually enter/copy the package name

2015-02-02 15:43:48	dariocravero	the library is Readium.js and it doesn't come with a dist file :(, instead they force you to rebuild it every time
2015-02-02 15:44:07	dariocravero	alternatively, is there a way to have npm compile that package every time it pulls it?

2015-02-03 18:11:28	Havvy	No, that'd be logically a peer dependency, though not a package.json "peerDependency", and you're really just dependent upon the interface that module A provides.
2015-02-03 18:12:52	saebekassebil	Havvy: My thought exactly. However should this "interface" be as bare-bone as possible or could it be a fully-armed object with loads of methods?

2015-02-04 22:33:50	@othiym23	jgi: we have a patch for npm-registry-mock that causes all of the tests to pass for us: https://github.com/npm/npm-registry-mock/pull/24

2015-02-05 23:44:20	lewellyn	hm. i have npm 1.4.28, downloaded within the past two weeks. and strict-ssl being false still throws errors on SSL. i expect that it's not expecting a transparent ssl proxy or something :/

2015-02-05 23:44:57	@othiym23	lewellyn: 1.4.28 is pretty old at this point, and there are a bunch of proxy tweaks that make it more useful in 2.x

2015-02-05 23:44:32	lewellyn	ideally, there'd be an http-only option, but i don't see one.
2015-02-05 23:44:54	lewellyn	(no, i don't have the proxy information to input.)
2015-02-05 23:44:58	@othiym23	lewellyn: 1.4.28 is pretty old at this point, and there are a bunch of proxy tweaks that make it more useful in 2.x
2015-02-05 23:45:22	@othiym23	lewellyn: but yeah, if there's some kind of proxy config that needs to be added, you're going to at least need to know the proxy configuration
2015-02-05 23:45:32	lewellyn	1.4.28 is what came with node 0.10.35
2015-02-05 23:45:41	@othiym23	npm 2.x will pick it up from environment variables (but not the registry, if you're on Windows)
2015-02-05 23:45:43	@othiym23	it sure is!
2015-02-05 23:46:01	lewellyn	so how does one actually update it without access to the registry, properly? ;)
2015-02-05 23:46:06	@othiym23	but it's also about 30 revisions behind latest stable
2015-02-05 23:46:40	@othiym23	one way would be to get an io.js installer, or node 0.11.16
2015-02-05 23:47:31	lewellyn	i'm hoping to keep my team's install docs down to "go to nodejs.org and hit Download" if possible. (i'll avoid derailing onto io.js at the moment.)

2015-02-05 23:53:44	@othiym23	actually, without -L, because it sounds like this is a transparent proxy that may be expecting headers to be set
2015-02-05 23:54:15	@othiym23	if you get SSL failures when doing that, then the problem is that the proxy is intercepting requests and serving unencrypted responses to an encrypted request

2015-02-06 20:05:17	acmehandle	If I use nvm and install a package npm without the -g will that prevent it from sourcing to the shell correctly?
2015-02-06 20:05:51	acmehandle	I installed ember-cli using npm install ember-cli, where the instructions called for -g I did not use -g *but* node is installed via nvm.
2015-02-06 20:05:57	acmehandle	and I am logged in to that user
2015-02-06 20:05:58	ljharb	i'm not sure what that means - `npm install foo` will just install it locally in node_modules
2015-02-06 20:06:09	ljharb	if you don't use "-g" then it won't work as advertised
2015-02-06 20:06:25	ljharb	if the instructions say "use -g" then you should do that :-p
2015-02-06 20:06:59	qard	It *will* work in the npm scripts block when installed locally though. :)
2015-02-06 20:07:05	ljharb	indeed it will
2015-02-06 20:07:15	acmehandle	ok, at the risk of sounding like a broken record.  Since I installed node using nvm I can be assured that in the circumstances i mentioned earlier that those packages will still be 'sandboxed' to a degree
2015-02-06 20:07:16	qard	Which is super handy to know.
2015-02-06 20:07:23	acmehandle	even with -g
2015-02-06 20:07:29	ljharb	acmehandle: installing node using nvm does not affect `npm` usage whatsoever
2015-02-06 20:07:44	ljharb	`npm install -g foo` with nvm will be "sandboxed" because `npm root -g` is.
2015-02-06 20:08:04	ljharb	so just check where `npm root -g` is, and that's where `npm install -g` will install to.
2015-02-06 20:08:09	acmehandle	Ok.  I think I understand.
2015-02-06 20:08:11	acmehandle	Ah, ok. I see.
2015-02-06 20:08:26	acmehandle	Ok. yes.  Good.  Very pleased.
2015-02-06 20:08:29	acmehandle	Thank you!!
2015-02-06 20:08:30	qard	Changing node versions with nvm is really just changing a symlink.
2015-02-06 20:09:21	qard	(With some magic)
2015-02-06 20:09:23	ljharb	qard: nope
2015-02-06 20:09:25	ljharb	it's changing your PATH.
2015-02-06 20:09:30	ljharb	no symlinks whatsoever. that's n/ny.
2015-02-06 20:10:08	qard	Well, there's the .nvm/current thing, which is what I was referring to.
2015-02-06 20:10:13	ljharb	oh right true
2015-02-06 20:10:14	qard	But yes, there's some magic in there.
2015-02-06 20:10:18	ljharb	i've got to disable that
2015-02-06 20:10:25	ljharb	that current symlink has been nothing but trouble :-)
2015-02-06 20:10:49	ljharb	ah wait, i already made it not the default

2015-02-06 20:11:47	qard	I haven't looked at the code lately, so I guess it's changed a bit. :)
2015-02-06 20:12:07	qard	Eventually I'll actually finish my alternative thing... https://github.com/qard/jsenv
2015-02-06 20:13:19	qard	It installs and lists remote and local versions fine, but doesn't actually make stuff available on PATH yet.
2015-02-06 20:14:07	qard	I need to set up a Windows dev env at some point to test, since I'm trying to make it a cross-platform thing.

2015-02-09 11:09:23	hnsr	anyone here use npm for globally installing packages on Fedora (or any RHEL-related distros)? I'm looking for some advice on how to make this work safely, as it seems that in the default  setup, the node.js packages that are available as RPMs through yum install in the same directory as where 'npm install -g ..' installs, which is causing some issues for me
2015-02-09 11:10:09	hnsr	I was going to modify my 'prefix' so npm installs somewhere else and I think that will work, but I'm just curious how other people have gone about it to see if there are any better solutions

2015-02-10 20:40:36	niggler	for docs, should the repository be referred to as NPM or npm?
2015-02-10 20:41:06	erichf	Hello, I just did `npm install -g express` inside of a docker container. Doing `express -V` gives an express command not found error
2015-02-10 20:41:09	erichf	any thoughts?
2015-02-10 20:41:50	yoshuawuyts1	erichf: express doesn't have a `bin` field in the `package.json`, ergo it's not available globally
2015-02-10 20:41:56	@othiym23	niggler: the CLI, registry, company, and weltanschuung should all be referred to as simply "npm"
2015-02-10 20:42:20	yoshuawuyts1	erichf: I think you're looking for `express-generator` http://expressjs.com/starter/generator.html

2015-02-10 20:43:46	yoshuawuyts1	erichf: it isn't
2015-02-10 20:43:54	yoshuawuyts1	erichf: https://github.com/strongloop/express/blob/master/package.json code doesn't lie
2015-02-10 20:44:20	erichf	yoshuawuyts1: I'm not well versed on these package.json files
2015-02-10 20:44:38	erichf	yoshuawuyts1: I'm guessing I look at the files array, and dont see a bin folder?
2015-02-10 20:45:26	yoshuawuyts1	erichf: hah, yeah it takes a while to understand them. Beyond the obvious fields (name, repo, etc.), `dependencies` and `devDependencies` there's another one called `bin` which specifies a command that can be run when installed globally
2015-02-10 20:45:51	erichf	yoshuawuyts1: http://pastebin.com/T2EWdhsr -- good call
2015-02-10 20:46:47	yoshuawuyts1	erichf: if you're new to node and would like to learn more, I can recommend nodeschool -- http://nodeschool.io/

2015-02-10 20:47:48	erichf	yoshuawuyts1: awesome thanks, I'm just following a tutorial right now, proving out some docker functionality
2015-02-10 20:49:19	yoshuawuyts1	erichf: ps. here's some unwarranted advice: ditch MEAN and come over to the LEBRON side of life -- http://lebron.technology/

2015-02-10 20:51:30	niggler	othiym23: somewhat unrelated: is there a catchall term for nodejs and iojs?
2015-02-10 20:51:48	gkatsev	node?
2015-02-10 20:52:01	@othiym23	niggler: I just say "node" when I mean "things that run JavaScript using the Node.js and io.js APIs"
2015-02-10 20:52:42	yoshuawuyts1	othiym23: niggler I just go with SSJS (pronounced: shhhhh)
2015-02-10 20:52:50	niggler	heh yoshuawuyts1
2015-02-10 20:52:56	yoshuawuyts1	(not really, actually. Node is the way to go)
2015-02-10 20:53:02	yoshuawuyts1	Server Side JavaScript
2015-02-10 20:53:18	yoshuawuyts1	okay, messed up the order of my joke, funny nevertheless
2015-02-10 20:53:39	niggler	im trying to rework some READMEs
2015-02-10 20:54:00	gkatsev	I don't really see any need to rework readmes quite yet
2015-02-10 20:55:12	niggler	0.12 has some issues that iojs has already resolved
2015-02-10 20:55:33	gkatsev	than just add that as a caveat
2015-02-10 20:56:09	niggler	is it appropriate to refer to iojs as a version of node?
2015-02-10 20:56:29	@othiym23	niggler: depends on who you ask
2015-02-10 20:56:40	@othiym23	niggler: also sort of depends on how things go with the foundation
2015-02-10 20:57:03	@othiym23	for now, it's probably best to call it a node-compatible fork rather than a version

2015-02-10 20:57:26	niggler	then another line IE ... and another line Chrome ...
2015-02-10 20:57:40	niggler	is it more appropriate to add a new line for iojs or should i combine it with the nodejs line

2015-02-10 21:10:08	@othiym23	gozala: I commented on the issue, but to expand a little: `semver@4`'s main change from previous versions is that it no longer treats prerelease versions as matching semver ranges
2015-02-10 21:11:12	@othiym23	gozala: so if you have a semver range depending on >=0.12.0, 0.13.0-beta.1 won't match
2015-02-10 21:11:28	@othiym23	gozala: it's in the semver docs, but it's easy to overlook
2015-02-10 21:11:45	@othiym23	it's not that huge a change, but it's definitely jarring the first time you run into it, especially with peerDependencies
2015-02-10 21:12:42	gozala	othiym23: tnx for looking, I'm not sure I get the solution though
2015-02-10 21:13:10	@othiym23	gozala: don't depend on a prerelease version, or make everything depend explicitly on the same prerelease version
2015-02-10 21:13:51	gozala	othiym23: yeah but I don't control dependency that declared a pee dependency
2015-02-10 21:14:19	gozala	othiym23: is there any way omniscient could say use either >=react@0.12.0 or the beta ?

2015-02-12 14:31:50	AAoK	Okay I know this is a vague question, I know. I just can't find any 101 of creating a project or anything, I don't know how to handle my process

2015-02-15 18:26:33	dickeyxxx	hey everyone, I'm using npm in a semi-unique way on the Heroku CLI. I'm using it as a plugin framework by installing packages into ~/.heroku/node_modules. My goal is to keep both the iojs and npm install outside of anything that might or might not be on the user's box. This is working pretty well, but I ran into a problem.
2015-02-15 18:27:27	dickeyxxx	I run `npm update` inside ~/.heroku in order to update the plugins. I had a user run the cli and it attempted to update the `~/node_modules` folder which had some things owned by root inside of it and crashed

2015-02-15 18:28:26	dickeyxxx	so my question is, is there a way to sort of lock `npm update` to a specific directory and not move up? also, is my understanding correct that `npm update` will only touch the current directory if it has a node_modules folder?

2015-02-15 19:05:19	dickeyxxx	you know what, I was able to answer my own question. This was a case where the node_modules directory didn't exist at all. There doesn't appear to be a way to lock it down, but I think I can better solve the problem by ensuring the node_modules directory exists in the place I want it
2015-02-15 19:06:03	dickeyxxx	in any case, if you're curious on how I'm using npm here, I wrote up a document describing it: https://github.com/heroku/heroku-hello-world I think it's a neat use-case for npm

2015-02-15 21:58:05	Industrial	How do I get NPM to display each line of the thing it's doing like it used to? Can I disable the spinner behaviour?

2015-02-17 20:42:13	matuzak	so that wouldn't make much sense

2015-02-17 20:59:28	richardlitt	So.. does anyone know what I do if I want to use a module that has a dependency that I've submitted a PR too, but isn't merged in yet?
2015-02-17 20:59:41	richardlitt	actually, a dep of a dep of a dep of a dep
2015-02-17 21:00:00	ljharb	wait
2015-02-17 21:00:13	richardlitt	for? Each dep to merge in the changes?
2015-02-17 21:00:33	ljharb	well, if it's nonbreaking, the semver ranges should pull it all the way down the tree theoretically
2015-02-17 21:00:42	richardlitt	it's breaking.
2015-02-17 21:00:48	richardlitt	well, breaks my build, anyway
2015-02-17 21:02:54	ljharb	no i don't mean the bug
2015-02-17 21:03:07	ljharb	i mean if the fix doesn't break the semantics of the great-grand-dep, then it won't be a major version bump
2015-02-17 21:03:15	ljharb	and then it's highly likely to be automatically included up the tree by the semver ranges.
2015-02-17 21:04:17	richardlitt	cool.
2015-02-17 21:04:21	richardlitt	I won't be
2015-02-17 21:04:24	richardlitt	*it
2015-02-17 21:05:00	richardlitt	What do I do until it is merged? There are 3 outstanding PRs and the module hasn't been updated in four months, so I'm not sure if waiting is an option
2015-02-17 21:05:11	richardlitt	Is there a standard protocol for dealing with situations like this?
2015-02-17 21:05:30	ljharb	usually what i do if i'm using something that's not being maintained is use something else
2015-02-17 21:07:16	richardlitt	yeah. Don't really want to do that
2015-02-17 21:07:27	ljharb	you could fork it
2015-02-17 21:07:36	ljharb	and then convince the upstream modules to use your fork
2015-02-17 21:07:48	richardlitt	hmm

2015-02-17 22:05:43	sandinmyjoints	I have some git repos in my package.json using the git+ssh://git@github.com format. Whenever I run npm install, it appears to refetch and install these deps, even when they are already installed. That doesn't happen for other deps that are on the npm package registry. Is this typical behavior? Is there a way I can prevent these deps from being refetched?

2015-02-18 11:45:40	iarna	Right
2015-02-18 11:46:28	iarna	The 2.6.0 is the deprecation warning (while still installing modules). 3.0.0 is the "warning when missing, but continuing"
2015-02-18 11:47:58	iarna	And from then on it'll warn. I think as a warning it's important and useful. And it avoids the "doing the wrong thing quietly" that the current behavior results in when there are conflicts.

2015-02-18 15:04:09	John	I don't know what i mean
2015-02-18 15:04:39	John	I think I just want my users to be able to run "npm install [my program name]", to get all the dependancies for my program
2015-02-18 15:04:47	John	Or even the program itself?
2015-02-18 15:04:55	John	I dont know how that would work
2015-02-18 15:05:18	esatterwhite	define a package.json and publish it to npm
2015-02-18 15:05:28	esatterwhite	then they can npm install {your program}

2015-02-20 16:23:32	pluma	Basically I want to blacklist certain modules from npm install even if dependencies have those modules as dependencies.

2015-02-23 14:09:37	daxim	I'm always overwelmed when looking for npm packages, where are the curated lists of what's orthodox and works in 90% of the cases?
2015-02-23 14:10:15	daxim	who takes care of comparing packages and their functionality?
2015-02-23 14:10:17	yoshuawuyts	daxim: configumon does have the configuration part built in, doesn't have the extensability though. Though in theory you could call configumon another time per class

2015-02-25 12:21:24	iarna	Huh, so TIL that `npm outdated` only shows you modules that are outdated that are in your package.json or that are installed UNDER a module in your package.json
2015-02-25 12:21:32	iarna	If you deduped it's not gonna work right.
2015-02-25 12:21:44	iarna	At least, not if dedup hoisted anything to the top level.
2015-02-25 12:23:13	yoshuawuyts	iarna: doesn't sound like a feature
2015-02-25 12:23:26	yoshuawuyts	iarna: but good to know, thanks for sharing
2015-02-25 12:23:53	iarna	(We're trying to move our internal monologuing out to the channel, so you'll see more stuff like that as time goes on.)
2015-02-25 12:24:05	iarna	And no, I wouldn't call it a feature.
2015-02-25 12:24:30	iarna	It also means that as it stands today it's totally inadequate for use with a maximally flat dependency tree.
2015-02-25 12:24:41	yoshuawuyts	iarna: \o/ that's great to hear!

2015-02-25 12:25:35	iarna	Buut... updating `npm outdated` to use the logical tree that the new `npm ls` uses should allow that code to survive mostly untouched AND fix that bug.
2015-02-25 12:27:00	iarna	Which would then allow me to actually use it in the new `npm update`, which in turn would allow me to actually have `npm update` not work exactly like the new `npm dedup`. Which would be nice. ?

2015-02-25 12:29:42	yoshuawuyts	iarna: what changed with npm dedupe? Find the npm changelog hard to work through sometimes, compared to the io.js changelog.
2015-02-25 12:30:00	iarna	Nothing's changed yet
2015-02-25 12:30:32	iarna	but npm@3 is bringing a rewrite of `npm install`, which results needing to touch most of the other module management commands.
2015-02-25 12:30:46	yoshuawuyts	iarna: multi-stage install right?
2015-02-25 12:30:50	iarna	Right
2015-02-25 12:31:20	iarna	It produces as-flat-as-possible node_modules folders now, but it won't mess with existing trees.
2015-02-25 12:31:30	iarna	So the new dedup is how you'll flatten a new tree, if that's what you want.
2015-02-25 12:31:39	iarna	(flatten an *existing* tree)
2015-02-25 12:32:11	yoshuawuyts	iarna: I've been wanting to ask about that: is there an ETA on npm@3? There's a nasty shrinkwrap bug that interacts with local deps that's probably going to be fixed with 3.
2015-02-25 12:32:39	iarna	soon? ? I *really* wanted to have it ready this month but as it's the 25th... ?
2015-02-25 12:33:25	iarna	And can you point me at that bug? 'cause if it looks like it should be fixed, I'd like to make sure it is.
2015-02-25 12:33:31	yoshuawuyts	iarna: :o dope! Given the rate of the milestone I was expecting it to be somewhere in June, but glad to hear you've progressed!
2015-02-25 12:33:39	yoshuawuyts	iarna: oh, haven't reported it yet hah
2015-02-25 12:33:52	yoshuawuyts	iarna: but I'll do that right now
2015-02-25 12:33:57	iarna	Awesome
2015-02-25 12:34:55	iarna	Yeah, I kind of declared bankruptcy on the milestone ? I kind of don't like closing tickets before the code is actually released, but that got into a "I never close anything" place.
2015-02-25 12:36:30	yoshuawuyts	iarna: GH issues / milestones to manage feature development is tricky
2015-02-25 12:37:12	yoshuawuyts	iarna: but we're doing the same thing, also running into the fact that issues don't represent the actual state of the project

2015-02-25 12:46:06	yoshuawuyts	hmm, ran into the issue again though. Thought it was shrinkwrap that failed (which made me happy cause it stopped failing), but it
2015-02-25 12:46:21	yoshuawuyts	's actually npm install that doesn't work with shrinkwrap if you have local modules in it.

2015-02-25 13:00:49	iarna	terinjokes: shrinkwrap generation hasn't changed, but yeah, all the code for installing from them is changing. Plus the "update shrinkwrap when you do an install --save or uninstall --save" thing.
2015-02-25 13:01:12	terinjokes	Google Now is pretty good at telling me when i have upcoming checkins, which has been helpful
2015-02-25 13:01:39	yoshuawuyts	iarna: it's installation that's broken, so that's good news! Also, dope that auto-updates are coming through :D
2015-02-25 13:01:47	terinjokes	iarna: right, that's what I meant. Installing from them that is broken
2015-02-25 13:02:08	iarna	yoshuawuyts: auto-updates? ?
2015-02-25 13:02:30	iarna	Or just that `npm update` won't be broken any more? ?
2015-02-25 13:02:31	terinjokes	Auto add to shrinkwrap?

2015-02-25 13:09:28	yoshuawuyts	terinjokes: and that's even without using symlinks / linklocal. We're in a blissful hell with our production setup atm.
2015-02-25 13:10:03	yoshuawuyts	code is super clean and loosely coupled, npm fails 40% of all builds or so
2015-02-25 13:10:34	terinjokes	yoshuawuyts: we wanted to use them because we have lots of small modules with the same set of dev dependencies
2015-02-25 13:11:37	yoshuawuyts	terinjokes: what's your experience with npm-cache? Currently causing a lot of issues for our users atm and also our own setup when combined with an external cache

2015-02-25 13:12:07	terinjokes	About 5 weeks outdated
2015-02-25 13:12:28	terinjokes	I started working on a small wrapper around npm for some things
2015-02-25 13:12:44	yoshuawuyts	iarna: our application is modelled similar to this project -- https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/finfin
2015-02-25 13:12:53	yoshuawuyts	iarna: might give you an idea of what we're doing
2015-02-25 13:13:18	iarna	yoshuawuyts: And I'm really gonna need an example package.json & npm-shrinkwrap.json, or steps to produce the breaking scenario?
2015-02-25 13:13:55	iarna	Oh I see, that's an interesting pattern!
2015-02-25 13:15:06	yoshuawuyts	iarna: shrinkwrap also fails on the app I just linked
2015-02-25 13:15:16	iarna	Ah, excellent, thank you
2015-02-25 13:15:49	yoshuawuyts	iarna: np, I'm happy to help you help me ^^
2015-02-25 13:16:19	yoshuawuyts	iarna: or just generally happy, idk
2015-02-25 13:17:15	iarna	Either way ?
2015-02-25 13:17:33	iarna	My simple attempt at a test case failed to fail, so I'm trying out finfin now

2015-02-25 13:21:35	iarna	ok, so the problem seems to be that the generated shrinkwrap in this case doesn't have a "resolved" field pointing at the local directory, it only has a version, as such, installing from the shrinkwrap tries to fetch from the registry, which of course fails.
2015-02-25 13:22:32	yoshuawuyts	iarna: ah right. So that also means npm@3.0 won't automatically fix this
2015-02-25 13:22:36	iarna	Right
2015-02-25 13:22:38	iarna	When I try to shrinkwrap something installed with `npm link` I get the same kind of behavior, but I *didn't* get that behavior with a single local package with no deps of its own. Hmm.
2015-02-25 13:22:42	iarna	Well, maybe ?
2015-02-25 13:26:39	yoshuawuyts	iarna: oh something totally unrelated: I'll be in oakland / SF in a few weeks. Would love to swing by the office and say hi. Can I? :D
2015-02-25 13:27:47	iarna	It looks like it's actually a bug in the parsing of package specifiers, when scopes and local files are both involved.

2015-02-25 13:42:20	yoshuawuyts	terinjokes: *drumroll*
2015-02-25 13:42:28	iarna	yoshuawuyts: So, this use of linklocal is kind of weird... it installs all of your local packages, then removes the installed versions and links them.
2015-02-25 13:42:53	yoshuawuyts	iarna: yup, abusing it super hard. Should probably move it to not be part of post_install
2015-02-25 13:43:07	iarna	So local packages work just fine here, it's that linked packages just don't work with npm-shrinkwrap
2015-02-25 13:43:32	iarna	Because shrinkwrap looks for metadata in the package.json that `npm install` puts there to make sure you get exactly the same thing.
2015-02-25 13:43:48	terinjokes	It blows my mind that I can message you from deep underground in a subway tunnel. Stockholm...
2015-02-25 13:44:16	iarna	<3 cell coverage in subways? we got that here a few years back
2015-02-25 13:44:53	iarna	Now, as these are actually a part of the same repo, you _could_ just hack in the private metadata that npm is looking for. But those fields are undocumented and thus we reserve the right to change them without calling it breaking.
2015-02-25 13:45:01	yoshuawuyts	linklocal is not the solution we actually want to be using, but it's the only way to make this setup work while developing. Might be something that would be cool if it was baked into npm itself, but that's a different discussion.
2015-02-25 13:45:56	yoshuawuyts	iarna: using shrinkwrap when stuff isn't symlinked works then. That seems to make it a linklocal issue rather than an npm issue
2015-02-25 13:46:09	yoshuawuyts	though breaking metadata :(
2015-02-25 13:47:04	yoshuawuyts	iarna: what was the use case for local modules when it was first introduced? Is it different than what I'm doing with finfin?
2015-02-25 13:47:23	yoshuawuyts	just curious ^^
2015-02-25 13:47:38	yoshuawuyts	terinjokes: amsterdam too!
2015-02-25 13:48:15	iarna	I'm honestly not sure. Maybe sites where they have a global disk?
2015-02-25 13:48:15	terinjokes	yoshuawuyts: my tele2 sim claimed I was roaming the whole time, so it killed my battery
2015-02-25 13:48:34	iarna	I use it when testing during development

2015-02-25 19:10:14	ljharb	if you specify version 1.0 in engines you're pretty unlikely to get node :-)
2015-02-25 19:10:25	@othiym23	kenperkins: no, but you can approximate it, like ljharb says

2015-02-25 19:10:52	kenperkins	what happens when node is `1.3.0`
2015-02-25 19:11:02	@othiym23	kenperkins: see also https://github.com/iojs/io.js/issues/269
2015-02-25 19:11:08	kenperkins	ty
2015-02-25 19:11:34	@othiym23	there isn't yet a consensus around when and what npm should do about that
2015-02-25 19:11:53	@othiym23	people seem to be settling on feature testing, but that feels kinda gnarly to me from a stability point of view
2015-02-25 19:12:16	ljharb	how long do you guess that might take for node to hit 1.0 tho
2015-02-25 19:12:20	@othiym23	the other thing some people are talking about is looking at the version of V8 and dispatching on that, but that seems labor-intensive and error prone
2015-02-25 19:12:27	@othiym23	it's still kinda a Wild West
2015-02-25 19:12:48	@othiym23	ljharb: my guess is that Node will never hit 1.0 as an entity independent of io.js
2015-02-25 19:12:51	@othiym23	but it's just a guess
2015-02-25 19:13:08	@othiym23	which is a hazardous way to do engineering
2015-02-25 19:13:20	kenperkins	<ljharb>	how long do you guess that might take for node to hit 1.0 tho
2015-02-25 19:13:24	kenperkins	no idea, it's just a risk isn't it?
2015-02-25 19:13:47	smikes	othiym23 so far I have exactly 1 issue that I'd like you take a look at.  Got 30 seconds?
2015-02-25 19:13:48	kenperkins	othiym23 looking at v8 version feels leaky
2015-02-25 19:14:07	ljharb	kenperkins: by the time node hits 1.0, do you think it will lack any features io.js has now?
2015-02-25 19:14:19	kenperkins	I have nothing to add other than speculation there
2015-02-25 19:14:24	kenperkins	so, not sure if it's valuable
2015-02-25 19:14:28	ljharb	fair
2015-02-25 19:14:35	@othiym23	smikes: I'm about to head out and walk my dog ;)
2015-02-25 19:14:37	@othiym23	remind me later
2015-02-25 19:14:43	smikes	Personally I say tc39/test262 should specify canonical names for all features
2015-02-25 19:14:49	smikes	and then we can easily feature-test
2015-02-25 19:15:26	smikes	othiym23: no worries.  So far everything is low priority, one case where guess-explained something
2015-02-25 19:15:32	smikes	and want a double-check, that's all
2015-02-25 19:17:37	kenperkins	i so completely disagree about v8 version
2015-02-25 19:18:26	kenperkins	(using that as the mechanism for npm)
2015-02-25 19:20:02	@othiym23	kenperkins: this lack of consensus is why we as a team haven't done anything and why you should just use the node version for now
2015-02-25 19:20:24	kenperkins	:)
2015-02-25 19:20:29	kenperkins	yea, I'm not complaining
2015-02-25 19:20:37	kenperkins	was more curious as a participant
2015-02-25 19:20:43	@othiym23	there still isn't a super reliable way to tell whether you're running node or iojs aside from looking at the V8 version or sniffing process.execPath and hoping that the binaries still have their default install names
2015-02-25 19:21:07	 *	kenperkins stresses over python2/3 situ
2015-02-25 19:22:06	kenperkins	I'm a little late to the party but this seems a broad assumption: "future versions of node will be likely be api & v8 compatible with iojs"

2015-02-25 20:22:04	@othiym23	yoshuawuyts: that's on me, iarna and I have made plans to put a roadmap in a more public place but I haven't gotten around to it
2015-02-25 20:22:43	yoshuawuyts	othiym23: \o/
2015-02-25 20:23:04	@othiym23	but the high-level summary is multi-stage install / npm@3, rewrite of the caching layer / npm@4, supporting the rollout of private modules on the registry, fixing npm's test framework, and "solving the front-end tooling problem"
2015-02-25 20:23:21	@othiym23	that last one is in quotes because we don't really know what the ultimate solution might look like, and we don't expect to finish that this year

2015-02-25 20:27:35	@othiym23	yoshuawuyts: basically the cache is going to become a content-addressable store, so we can eliminate a lot of staleness checking
2015-02-25 20:27:54	yoshuawuyts	othiym23: actually would like to help out on some of these, though haven't contributed before. 600 issues and no open roadmap can be a bit daunting :P
2015-02-25 20:28:18	@othiym23	i.e. if you have a shrinkwrap file, it will have the hash for the package, and if that hash is in the cache, then you can pull the tarballs straight out of cache without even doing a freshness check / redownloading the package from the package server

2015-02-25 20:28:46	@othiym23	yoshuawuyts: one of my projects is to close as many of the feature requests we're not going to implement as I can
2015-02-25 20:28:49	@othiym23	for exactly that reason
2015-02-25 20:28:58	@othiym23	and to merge / kill all of the pending pull requests
2015-02-25 20:29:19	@othiym23	the issue tracker is in much much better shape than it was in six months ago, but it's still a bit of a daunting thing
2015-02-25 20:29:33	@othiym23	it doesn't help that it serves three distinct roles
2015-02-25 20:31:06	yoshuawuyts	user support / managing external contributions / progress management on milestones? something like that?
2015-02-25 20:32:53	yoshuawuyts	I'm guess that if you introduce the roadmap it will be a two-edged sword. On the one end it might reduce feature requests since the information is centralized and on the other hand it might empower the community to step in and answer questions since they now possess more knowledge
2015-02-25 20:33:01	yoshuawuyts	s/guess/guessing/
2015-02-25 20:33:07	@othiym23	support, feature requests, and actual bugs
2015-02-25 20:34:01	@othiym23	yoshuawuyts: the real risk is ETERNAL BIKESHEDDING, because there are many opinionated members of the npm community and only a very tenuous consensus about most things
2015-02-25 20:34:03	yoshuawuyts	how do you keep track of progress on features developed by the team? We use quip to get a birds eye view + issues for the individual todo's, but even that feels lacking.

2015-02-25 20:40:25	yoshuawuyts	but naw, for a roadmap all I could ever ask is what general direction / decisions have been taken. You pretty much answered that in your message above. Can image more people would be interested ^^

2015-02-26 18:41:45	smikes	Yes
2015-02-26 18:42:31	prbc	smikes: you told me yesterday to install form nodesource
2015-02-26 18:42:48	smikes	Yes, I think that's a better long-term plan than compiling your own
2015-02-26 18:42:50	prbc	I did it, after installing ubuntu
2015-02-26 18:42:58	smikes	Did you see any difference between 0.10 and 0.12?
2015-02-26 18:43:05	prbc	but I remaing in the same issue
2015-02-26 18:43:07	smikes	nodesource also has modules for RedHat/Fedora/CentOS
2015-02-26 18:43:23	prbc	I tried 3 different distros
2015-02-26 18:43:24	smikes	Ok, let's try running the process through strace
2015-02-26 18:43:28	prbc	Fedora, elmentary, ubuntu
2015-02-26 18:43:52	smikes	run strace node $(which npm) install glob
2015-02-26 18:44:04	prbc	smikes: this guy describes a similar problem here https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/7247 but I dont use vagrant
2015-02-26 18:44:07	smikes	This should produce lots of output until the hang
2015-02-26 18:44:15	smikes	Are you using a shared filesystem, though?
2015-02-26 18:46:55	prbc	smikes: I don't know what you mean, but its just a secondary computer here, dell inspiron with ubuntu 14.04 64bit, i5, 4gb RAM, I used to work in it with node/npm without problems
2015-02-26 18:47:25	smikes	Okay, that answers my question.  That other user had a slow filesystem because it was shared via nfs between the host and the vagrant instance
2015-02-26 18:47:47	smikes	If you're running on a non-virtual machine, that's not relevant
2015-02-26 18:48:10	smikes	Have you run the strace command I suggested above?

2015-02-27 16:50:35	iarna	`npm outdated` doesn't give the output I want, yet.
2015-02-27 16:50:56	iarna	Symlinked deps haven't had their special cases implemented as yet. It'll work with them, mostly, but it may not do the right thing. I don't recommend it.

2015-02-27 16:52:26	iarna	And finally, npm publish with bundled deps won't pick up the flattened nested deps correctly yet.
2015-02-27 16:53:38	yoshuawuyts	hmh, our source makes heavy use of symlinks (linklocal) so that might be an issue. Will it help you if I try it out nevertheless and report what's going wrong, or will that be mostly moot?

2015-03-02 12:19:34	hnsr	is there a consensus on whether or not 'node_modules' should be checked into version control for deploying a node app (i.e. a website)? I've read some conflicting things but maybe some of those were dated. I get that shrinkwrapping solves the dep version issue, but then you'd still be dependent on the npm registry being available during deployment (but maybe that's not something worth worrying about)

2015-03-02 13:24:30	Boogymanx	so I have an index.js file with the first script (var graph = ... up to fabricGraphics.run();)
2015-03-02 13:25:09	Boogymanx	and I used browserify (browserify -s ngraph -d index.js > bundle.js) to create the bundle
2015-03-02 13:25:22	Boogymanx	I'm aware that it's not really npm-related but the other related channels are dead

2015-03-02 13:26:03	yoshuawuyts	Boogymanx: interesting. Never seen the `require('something.somethingElse')` syntax. If it works, it's not used often.
2015-03-02 13:26:26	Boogymanx	I think that's because there is no main ngraph package, only the subpackages
2015-03-02 13:26:32	Boogymanx	it works in his demos :p
2015-03-02 13:26:47	yoshuawuyts	oh wait, it's just a separate repo

2015-03-02 13:37:12	yoshuawuyts	Boogymanx: I'm pretty confident in the way browserify resolves things, so you might want to open an issue about this in the ngraph.fabric repo / ngraph repo
2015-03-02 13:37:28	yoshuawuyts	Boogymanx: they can probably be of better assistance on this particular issue than I am
2015-03-02 13:37:49	Boogymanx	I thought an issue could be that my NODE_PATH wasn't set
2015-03-02 13:37:57	Boogymanx	I just set it but it's still not resolving
2015-03-02 13:38:39	Boogymanx	I've already opened a ticket there, but figured that I might get swifter assistance here
2015-03-02 13:39:44	yoshuawuyts	Boogymanx: setting node_path shouldn't matter I think
2015-03-02 13:39:59	yoshuawuyts	Boogymanx: but that's all I can do for you. Lunch break is over, good luck!
2015-03-02 13:40:11	Boogymanx	that was a possible solution I found on SO :)
2015-03-02 13:40:19	Boogymanx	All right, thanks for the assistance :D you too!

2015-03-02 13:54:58	saebekassebil	Hi guys. Is this the place to ask if "somebody" knows a module that does X?
2015-03-02 13:55:05	yoshuawuyts	saebekassebil: yup
2015-03-02 13:55:12	saebekassebil	cheers.
2015-03-02 13:55:51	saebekassebil	Is there a module that "counts up" to something. Say I want an animation of a counter going from 0 to 3000
2015-03-02 13:56:22	saebekassebil	I reckon it'd give me a callback with the next value to show, until it hit 3000
2015-03-02 13:56:59	yoshuawuyts	saebekassebil: won't a recursive function with a setTimeout in it suffice?
2015-03-02 13:57:33	yoshuawuyts	saebekassebil: what you're describing sounds like 3 lines of code
2015-03-02 13:57:40	saebekassebil	yoshuawuyts: yea.. actually it kinda would
2015-03-02 13:58:21	yoshuawuyts	saebekassebil: don't think RAF is what you want in this case, since you want to control the timeout I assume?

2015-03-03 01:05:47	@othiym23	if anybody ever wants to claim that module, or wants to file a request to get it taken down, it's probably in violation of our terms of service

2015-03-03 01:13:02	ljharb	is it even possible to require that module tho?
2015-03-03 01:15:22	chiper	othiym23:  it might not be a bad idea for npm to reject core module names
2015-03-03 01:15:47	@othiym23	chiper: that's been proposed before, but that's where some of the browserify shims live
2015-03-03 01:15:53	@othiym23	npm is bigger than node at this point!
2015-03-03 01:23:26	ljharb	othiym23: when you get to that place where people actually read warnings - what about having a warning when `npm install`ing a core module name?

2015-03-03 01:46:22	smikes	Okay.
2015-03-03 01:46:32	smikes	I have a bad feeling about node 0.12
2015-03-03 01:46:41	smikes	I think it has mysterious random failures
2015-03-03 01:47:09	smikes	But then I feel like warning people off of it, without concrete evidence of a problem, is just rumor-mongering
2015-03-03 01:47:31	@othiym23	this particular problem is not 0.12 or io.js specfic
2015-03-03 01:47:33	smikes	So overall ?\_(?)_/?
2015-03-03 01:47:47	@othiym23	it's something that changed in the HTTP agent in the long interregnum between 0.10 and now
2015-03-03 01:48:39	smikes	distinct from the no-https-on-Windows bug
2015-03-03 01:48:51	smikes	and distinct from the 'callback is not called, sometimes' bug ?
2015-03-03 01:50:13	smikes	Here's the callback bug: https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/9306
2015-03-03 01:50:31	smikes	I think that 'extra junk after gzipped content' problem was actually just exposing this one
2015-03-03 01:50:59	@othiym23	the no-https-on-WIndows thing was an io.js issue O:)
2015-03-03 01:51:50	@othiym23	that gzip patch should not have landed without more discussion, I think everybody was just trying to get everything closed out before the release
2015-03-03 01:52:02	@othiym23	it wouldn't be a new node release without something going bananas
2015-03-03 01:57:21	smikes	Well, I've only been around for a year, so I've never seen a new node release
2015-03-03 01:57:27	smikes	Maybe in a couple years I will see one
2015-03-03 01:58:55	ljharb	node 0.12 was released recently

2015-03-03 11:36:28	callumacrae	would I just checkout 3.0.10 (I'm using git), make some changes, and publish 3.0.11 as if I hadn't published 4.0.0?
2015-03-03 11:36:29	yoshuawuyts	It might be helpful to do some introductory Nodeschool.io courses if you haven't, just to get you up to speed

2015-03-03 11:37:56	Boogymanx	no, I'm a complete noob to node and js in general
2015-03-03 11:38:30	ljharb	callumacrae: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag
2015-03-03 11:38:40	callumacrae	Boogymanx: definitely do some courses! if you guess how to write js, it will often work, but won't be nice code

2015-03-03 11:39:10	yoshuawuyts	Boogymanx: in that case I think Nodeschool would indeed be the place to go (: Knowing about streams, npm and require() makes you feel a lot more confident about what you're doing

2015-03-04 09:24:45	andreypopp	Hi, has anyone built an alternative installed for npm registry which installs all deps in a single node_modules (yes, I know this will lead to more conflicts and failures)
2015-03-04 09:26:15	@othiym23	andreypopp: none of which I'm aware, but `registry-static` is pretty close to that
2015-03-04 09:26:27	@othiym23	andreypopp: http://npm.im/registry-static
2015-03-04 09:26:56	andreypopp	othiym23: thanks, I'll take a look
2015-03-04 09:27:28	andreypopp	hm... I need an installer which processes package.json, not npm mirror
2015-03-04 09:28:00	@othiym23	andreypopp: what problem are you trying to solve?
2015-03-04 09:28:49	andreypopp	othiym23: the presence of the same package multiple times in a browser bundle
2015-03-04 09:29:54	@othiym23	andreypopp: with a little bit of interpretation, the output of `npm dedupe` can help you find those situations
2015-03-04 09:30:47	andreypopp	yeah, I know about npm dedupe, but would prefer to use the tool which does that for me, preferably which uses SAT solver to choose the right versions

2015-03-04 11:08:17	binarious	Hi, I have a package.js file with a dependency to ?protractor: ^1.7.0? inside. The package.json of protractor has a dependency on the package ?optimist?. When I run ?npm install? optimist isn?t installed. Any ideas? I also get the error ?Cannot find module 'optimist?? when I want to run protractor.
2015-03-04 11:17:40	ljharb	hm, weird quotes
2015-03-04 11:17:52	ljharb	binarious: is optimist perhaps specified as a peerDependency of protractor? or is it a normal dependency
2015-03-04 11:18:36	binarious	ljharb: I don?t know. Is it? https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/package.json :)
2015-03-04 11:19:31	ljharb	what version of npm/node are you running?
2015-03-04 11:19:45	ljharb	also what do you mean by "run protractor"
2015-03-04 11:19:52	binarious	npm 2.5.1, node 0.12.0
2015-03-04 11:19:53	ljharb	it's possible `npm dedupe` pulled optimist up a level
2015-03-04 11:20:50	binarious	ljharb: I run ?# node ./node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update? and get the above error.
2015-03-04 11:21:08	ljharb	ah, yeah, don't do that :-)
2015-03-04 11:21:14	ljharb	you shouldn't ever need to dig into node_modules
2015-03-04 11:21:27	ljharb	make an `npm run-script` that only does `webdriver-manager update`
2015-03-04 11:21:37	ljharb	and then it should be able to find everything
2015-03-04 11:22:01	ljharb	like `scripts: { protractor: 'webdriver-manager update' }` in package.json, and `npm run protractor` to run it
2015-03-04 11:22:57	binarious	ljharb: uh ok, found that on their website. I?ll try that.
2015-03-04 11:23:56	binarious	But why isn?t optimist installed inside the node_modules folder of protractor? I think that?s the root problem.
2015-03-04 11:24:55	ljharb	if you require "protractor", and "A", and both of them require "optimist", npm will put "protractor", "A", and "optimist" all next to each other, to avoid duplicates
2015-03-04 11:24:59	ljharb	it's a feature
2015-03-04 11:25:37	binarious	so it?ll put optimist inside the root node_modules folder? But it?s not in there.
2015-03-04 11:25:43	ljharb	it means that whenever the PATH is set up correctly, protractor can `require` it
2015-03-04 11:25:50	ljharb	binarious: `npm ls` doesn't list optimist?
2015-03-04 11:26:10	ljharb	certainly if `npm install` doesn't end up with optimist being *somewhere* then that's a problem :-)
2015-03-04 11:26:32	binarious	npm ls displays a lot. npm install doesn?t show optimist though.
2015-03-04 11:27:00	ljharb	even with a `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`?
2015-03-04 11:28:09	binarious	I?ll check that

2015-03-04 12:11:18	PaulePanter	Hi. Do you know in http://paste.debian.net/159573/ why grunt-contrib-coffee or grunt is installed?
2015-03-04 12:11:38	dsdeiz	damn, i'm sorry, wrong channel
2015-03-04 12:11:52	PaulePanter	https://github.com/shipitjs/shipit/blob/master/package.json does not say anything about grunt.
2015-03-04 12:12:12	PaulePanter	Is there a way to find out why a certain package is installed? Like a dependency graph?
2015-03-04 12:13:06	PaulePanter	Nothing in `npm help` jumped to my eye.
2015-03-04 12:19:59	_rgn	PaulePanter: npm ls
2015-03-04 12:20:58	_rgn	PaulePanter: it could be a peerDependency
2015-03-04 12:23:03	_rgn	yep, check grunt-contrib-coffee/package.json, it has grunt as peerDependency
2015-03-04 12:23:27	_rgn	that makes it install grunt in a way that makes it seem like grunt is direct dependency of shipit
2015-03-04 12:23:56	_rgn	i don't thoroughly understand peerDependencies, just observed this happen before and got confused

2015-03-04 13:43:02	dsdeiz	i'm thinking it doesn't have a 'main' property and that if i add one the only thing available is dist/ng-table.js which isn't a module

2015-03-04 16:51:30	iarna	When I rewrote `npm ls` in npm#multi-stage, I changed it's internal data structures representing the tree, but it appears that a huge number of tests rely on this. So I'm gonna making it rewrite that tree back into the prior data structure before returning it.

2015-03-04 20:03:28	benjamin_	bradleymeck:, a one @othiym23 mentioned you had a feature request for yargs? you want to be able to more easily determine what arguments were defaulted?
2015-03-04 20:03:34	benjamin_	I like that idea.
2015-03-04 20:03:51	bradleymeck	i can't even figure it out at all right now
2015-03-04 20:04:44	benjamin_	bradleymeck: what API are you picturing, yargs.isDefault(key)?
2015-03-04 20:05:09	@othiym23	SomeKittens: the rule of thumb that npm follows is supporting back to the current stable release series minus one, so once io.js / 0.12 solidify, we too will probably drop support for 0.8
2015-03-04 20:05:20	@othiym23	but softly, because there are still a number of fairly big shops running it
2015-03-04 20:05:27	bradleymeck	isDefaulted makes more sense, isDefault makes it sound like is the value equal to the default
2015-03-04 20:05:43	SomeKittens	othiym23: alright, I think we'll keep 0.8 in there for now

2015-03-05 20:36:33	@othiym23	bradleymeck: yes, but it dual-boots Win 8.1, and sometimes I work under Windows
2015-03-05 20:37:09	bradleymeck	whats the recommended npm version + runtime (io or node version) right now
2015-03-05 20:37:33	bradleymeck	isaacs: fixed the npm bin bug that was trolling me, was w/ my loader code

2015-03-05 20:46:29	@othiym23	bradleymeck: recommended version is always `npm@latest`, but if you're using iojs, you should use the latest iojs and whatever version of npm it comes with, because it has the floating patch for node-gyp to work with iojs
2015-03-05 20:47:20	bradleymeck	mmm floating patch bad
2015-03-05 20:47:42	@othiym23	bradleymeck: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp/pull/564 and https://github.com/iojs/io.js/pull/493 need to get resolved before we can get rid of that patch
2015-03-05 20:48:31	@othiym23	as soon as TooTallNate puts out a fixed version of node-gyp (and I mean as *soon* as), I'll land it in npm
2015-03-05 20:50:50	bradleymeck	thats concerning since node-gyp ships with npm kinda
2015-03-05 20:51:11	austincheney	any idea how a package could go from 17k monthly downloads to 30k the next month and then 90k two weeks later? I am not doing any promotions or marketing so i cannot tell where the traffic is coming from

2015-03-06 22:06:40	bradleymeck	well npm explore creates a node process, a subshell, and then w/e it runs (npm run will spawn another node process, and another subshell)
2015-03-06 22:06:43	bradleymeck	therealkoopa: ^
2015-03-06 22:07:00	bradleymeck	we have a pretty hilarious project that is 11 processes deep because someone really likes npm
2015-03-06 22:07:23	Aria	Really liking npm ++
2015-03-06 22:07:30	Aria	Though flattening things out is a good idea.
2015-03-06 22:09:19	bradleymeck	nevar!
2015-03-06 22:09:54	bradleymeck	othiym23: thoughts on getting the bundled node-gyp moved outside of npm's source tree itself?
2015-03-06 22:10:56	 *	bradleymeck is not sure if it needs to be inside there for some reason besides convenience
2015-03-06 22:13:45	-->	bobmcw (~bobmcw@redhat/jboss/bobmcw) has joined #npm
2015-03-06 22:13:50	ljharb	why does npm need node-gyp?
2015-03-06 22:14:21	Aria	To compile native modules.
2015-03-06 22:14:32	bradleymeck	yea but it is in the source tree
2015-03-06 22:14:48	bradleymeck	https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/master/bin/node-gyp-bin/node-gyp
2015-03-06 22:15:07	bradleymeck	which causes some odd things as I am currently tasked w/ making npm into a standalone bin
2015-03-06 22:15:19	Aria	That's just a shell wrapper that lets it be overridden on the npm command line
2015-03-06 22:15:22	bradleymeck	node-gyp on inspection cannot be a standalone bin, cause of the addon.gypi
2015-03-06 22:15:34	bradleymeck	Aria: but by default it points inside of the source tree
2015-03-06 22:15:49	bradleymeck	for a standalone bin I can't run a child proc inside of the source tree
2015-03-06 22:15:54	Aria	Well, it by default uses the bundled copy, yes.
2015-03-06 22:16:03	Aria	Because npm has no dependencies that aren't bundled.
2015-03-06 22:16:26	bradleymeck	thats not really a requirement to my knowledge
2015-03-06 22:16:37	bradleymeck	since npm can install node-gyp
2015-03-06 22:17:19	Aria	Sure. And then rely on the user's maintenance of it.
2015-03-06 22:17:27	Aria	(if it's installed alongside)
2015-03-06 22:17:37	Aria	or it'd be weird to have something post-facto install things inside npm.

2015-03-06 22:17:53	bradleymeck	the point is why does it *need* to be in the source tree, if npm's installation process can put it alongside rather than inside
2015-03-06 22:18:05	bradleymeck	idc if its not installed via npm, just that it is not in the source tree itself

2015-03-06 22:18:34	bradleymeck	you wouldn't need to post install cause... how do you install npm? something else installs it. just add it to the install process of the install scripts
2015-03-06 22:19:17	ljharb	Aria: wouldn't node-gyp be a dep of any module that required it?
2015-03-06 22:20:10	bradleymeck	could be, but that would be very painful and produce *loads* of duplicate entries
2015-03-06 22:20:25	bradleymeck	one of the most important things is you want a node-gyp tested against your current npm / node version
2015-03-06 22:20:38	Aria	ljharb: That required it, yes, but it's treated as environmental instead.
2015-03-06 22:20:53	bradleymeck	I don't want users to be able to accidentally overwrite the version of node-gyp npm recommends
2015-03-06 22:21:05	bradleymeck	--node-gyp being explicit makes me happy

2015-03-06 22:22:54	bradleymeck	but I think that and working out updating single bin are my last steps
2015-03-06 22:23:23	<--	fiveisprime (~fiveispri@207-67-107-174.static.twtelecom.net) has quit (Quit: Quit)
2015-03-06 22:23:47	Aria	Why does it need to be a single bin?
2015-03-06 22:24:50	bradleymeck	mostly I am trying to decrease barriers to entry / uninstall hell
2015-03-06 22:25:27	bradleymeck	for us having a npm being a single binary means much better ability to run multiple versions of npm, which is currently kind a pipe dream
2015-03-06 22:26:26	bradleymeck	you get exactly 0 new features, just some maintainance happy things / being able to just pass npm/node files around w/o huge dir structures / install steps
2015-03-06 22:29:42	bradleymeck	Aria: one nice thing for npm devs (not me) is the ability to stop supporting old node versions in the code base since the runtime is in the same executable
2015-03-06 22:29:57	bradleymeck	but at the same time you have to run a release every time a security update lands that is relevant

2015-03-07 17:35:14	iarna	ashishk: Can you run `npm ls` in your project directory and paste in what you get as a result?

2015-03-07 17:48:53	iarna	ashishk: That means that the module is installed in your project, but not in your project.json. This means that if you were to share your project with others, they wouldn't get those modules.
2015-03-07 17:49:35	iarna	ashishk: If you'd like those to go away, try running:
2015-03-07 17:49:35	iarna	npm install --save htmlparser

2015-03-07 17:50:20	iarna	Adding --save to an npm command will result in the changes it makes being saved to your package.json
2015-03-07 17:50:45	ashishk	iarna:  thanks
2015-03-07 17:51:03	ashishk	iarna:  but still I am not able to add it in my project. I think I need to add something in
2015-03-07 17:51:15	ashishk	Gruntfile.coffee or bower.json or somewhere else
2015-03-07 17:51:30	ashishk	so that I would be able to include it

2015-03-07 17:51:46	iarna	It's possible that it's coffeescript related. ?\_(?)_/? I've not used it much personally.
2015-03-07 17:52:25	iarna	But I'd be surprised if require("htmlparser") resulted in "Cannot find module" error now.
2015-03-07 17:52:45	iarna	It's *definitely* not related to bower though
2015-03-07 17:53:11	ashishk	iarna:  No it is not giving that error but I am not able to use it
2015-03-07 17:53:21	iarna	What do you mean "not able to use it"?
2015-03-07 17:53:29	ashishk	iarna:  If I just write requre("htmlparser")
2015-03-07 17:53:32	ashishk	iarna:  No error
2015-03-07 17:53:40	iarna	Right, that loaded the module, then threw it away.
2015-03-07 17:53:47	iarna	I think what you want is:
2015-03-07 17:53:54	iarna	var htmlparser = require("htmlparser")
2015-03-07 17:54:22	ashishk	iarna:  yes **typo in above message

2015-03-07 17:54:58	ashishk	iarna:  var htmlparser = require("htmlparser") is not throwing any error
2015-03-07 17:55:01	iarna	Right
2015-03-07 17:55:14	iarna	So, what is it not doing that you expected it to do?
2015-03-07 17:55:27	ashishk	iarna:  While I am getting htmlparser as undefined if I do like console.log(htmlparser) after it.
2015-03-07 17:55:51	iarna	Can you share your test script?
2015-03-07 17:56:00	ashishk	iarna:  I want to use htmlparser's methods, var parser = new htmlparser.Parser(handler);
2015-03-07 17:56:26	ashishk	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/ED2GxnVc
2015-03-07 17:56:35	ashishk	iarna:  ^ here it is
2015-03-07 17:57:08	iarna	So that looks like browser side javascript?
2015-03-07 17:58:01	iarna	So yeah, probably you have a bundle that has to be built from your dependencies.
2015-03-07 17:58:14	iarna	aactually
2015-03-07 17:58:32	iarna	So, because that's not Node.js, require doesn't work the same.
2015-03-07 17:58:47	iarna	I think you want to change:
2015-03-07 17:58:56	iarna	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/WgCGrDpr
2015-03-07 17:58:59	iarna	to:
2015-03-07 17:59:11	iarna	  require(['droplet','htmlparser'], function(droplet, htmlparser) {
2015-03-07 18:00:07	iarna	Buut even still, I can't say that will work, there's probably a build step in here that you haven't discussed.
2015-03-07 18:00:40	iarna	These are all things I haven't had to work with personally. You'll likely find people with more direct experience over in the #Node.js channel.
2015-03-07 18:01:38	ashishk	iarna:  Yes, I think I need to change something Gruntfile.coffeee. Thanks for your help :)
2015-03-07 18:01:56	iarna	Sorry I couldn't help more! Good luck! =)

2015-03-08 17:37:01	_rgn	well, we had a discussion about this on #nodejs, but basically i experienced issues with travis and only after spending quite a lot of time trying to figure it out, i realized it was because mocha had updated (2.1.0 -> 2.2.0) just a day ago and had a bug
2015-03-08 17:38:30	_rgn	naturally i connected it to something i had changed

2015-03-08 17:45:10	@othiym23	_rng: you can pin exact versions, but that seems needlessly defensive to me
2015-03-08 17:45:16	_rgn	it can be nightmarish and potentially very time consuming for a programmer to have bugs emerge that are not a consequence of something you did, but still could be related
2015-03-08 17:45:32	@othiym23	most of the time people use semver correctly
2015-03-08 17:45:57	@othiym23	and this is an example of a simple bug, it sounds like
2015-03-08 17:46:27	@othiym23	not that URLs doesn't suck to have to spend a pile of time debugging Travis issues

2015-03-08 17:47:40	thealphanerd	othiym23: I had a crazy feature idea I wanted to run past you.. .although I don?t know if it could actually live in npm proper
2015-03-08 17:47:40	thealphanerd	specifically ```npm link repo-name [repo-address]```
2015-03-08 17:47:50	thealphanerd	by adding optional addres you will automatically install via git repo
2015-03-08 17:48:24	thealphanerd	_rgn: I made a utiltiy called chrono-dep that can check which deps have recently changed to chase down such bugs
2015-03-08 17:48:38	_rgn	i don't mind bugs, it would be naive to think there would never be any in software
2015-03-08 17:48:41	thealphanerd	although it is a little buggy right now, I don?t do anything smart regarding depth, so you can overflow the stack

2015-03-08 17:49:13	_rgn	it's just that it would've been better if i had got to experience the bug after deliberately updating modules, because then it's easier to connect cause and effect

2015-03-08 17:52:32	@othiym23	thealphanerd: I think you're right that that probably doesn't belong in npm proper
