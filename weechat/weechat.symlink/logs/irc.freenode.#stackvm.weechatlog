I.e i want to display a message for the user that is sort of sideband, and once the file loads, replace it entirely with the regular output. I thought to do it with a 302 (to the temp message) and js back, but that's such a gross hack-- it doesnt work for non-js browsers.

2015-02-06 16:42:39	mafintosh	yoshuawuyts: oh yea. it actually works quite well. i can boot ubuntu in ~20s using a 3g connection and no local cache :)
2015-02-06 16:43:54	yoshuawuyts	mafintosh: ooooooh. My co-workers just told me S3 also has an export-as-torrent option. Might cook up something cray with that
2015-02-06 16:44:32	mafintosh	yoshuawuyts: good idea. i think you just append ?torrent to an s3 url to get a torrent
2015-02-06 16:44:42	yoshuawuyts	mafintosh: but 20s over 3g is pretty crazy

2015-02-06 16:45:15	mafintosh	yoshuawuyts: its because you need to download very little on an image to actually boot it since the linux kernel is already running in docker
2015-02-06 16:45:42	mafintosh	yoshuawuyts: usually you just need to download bash (and its deps). this is all transparent though and handled by torrent-docker
2015-02-06 16:45:59	yoshuawuyts	mafintosh: you implemented a docker registry right? does it work well? we found tarballs to work better than a multi-layered graph db
2015-02-06 16:47:51	yoshuawuyts	mafintosh: (torrent-docker is still making my mind swoosh btw)
2015-02-06 16:48:27	mafintosh	yoshuawuyts: yes i did, https://github.com/mafintosh/docker-registry-server - its nice and simple and works quite well tbh
2015-02-06 16:49:55	mafintosh	yoshuawuyts: i demo it here, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9knGfbHID8#t=15m
2015-02-06 16:50:41	mafintosh	torrent-docker that is :)
2015-02-06 16:51:30	mafintosh	yoshuawuyts: i still need to get reduplication working across images - that would *really* awesome. so if you ever used a docker image that contained node then it would share that cache across other images that uses the same version of node
2015-02-06 16:53:28	yoshuawuyts	mafintosh: wow, that would be amazing.
2015-02-06 16:54:42	yoshuawuyts	mafintosh: wonder what the actual production value would be. Wonder if provisioning a whole bunch of servers could be possible with this, probably need to have private torrents though. Not sure if possible
2015-02-06 16:55:27	yoshuawuyts	mafintosh: but fun to think about nevertheless ^^

2015-02-10 15:41:05	terinjokes	not Array.isArray?
2015-02-10 15:45:22	yoshuawuyts1	terinjokes: var x = [1, 2, 3]; Array.isArray(x[0]) // => false
2015-02-10 15:45:38	jjjohnny	given a nested array of arrays, or 'rayrays', and a recursive function that takes a nested array as arg, is there any way to know if that the arg is the top level array, without having saved a reference to it?
2015-02-10 15:45:41	yoshuawuyts1	terinjokes: at least I think that's what jjjohnny meant. Array.isArray doesn't work for that
2015-02-10 15:46:25	 *	jjjohnny means AnyObject.isInArray(anyObject)
2015-02-10 15:46:51	yoshuawuyts1	jjjohnny: I think you can do indexOf for non-prototype values (e.g. no objects / functions)
2015-02-10 15:48:09	terinjokes	yoshuawuyts1: i was thinking "is this foreign object an Array", I missed the "in" in "is in an" :(
2015-02-10 15:49:17	yoshuawuyts1	jjjohnny: in that case terinjokes was right, `Array.isArray` is the way to check if something is an array.
2015-02-10 15:50:04	terinjokes	there's the ES7/ES2016/ES* proposal for [].includes, but that still requires have a reference to some array
2015-02-10 15:51:08	yoshuawuyts1	terinjokes: I think they should go with ES9000
2015-02-10 15:51:46	terinjokes	so that next year they can be "over nine thousand"?
2015-02-10 15:52:30	jjjohnny	the set of all objects which do not know they are contained in a set
2015-02-10 15:53:16	terinjokes	i think you just broke something
2015-02-10 15:54:09	yoshuawuyts1	terinjokes: was thinking more of HAL9000, but that works too.
2015-02-10 15:54:39	terinjokes	dark
2015-02-10 15:59:59	jjjohnny	the set of all objects, which do not know they are contained in a set of all objects?

2015-02-16 23:06:56	substack	that sounds like a pretty terrible bug in jenkins

2015-02-16 23:16:07	jfhbrook	and because it's so pervasive it falls on me to make sure that people's jenkins builds don't explode due to a misbehaving dependency

2015-02-16 23:20:19	jfhbrook	even if there were solid replacements for jenkins, that would just make jenkins the "ie of CI"

2015-02-16 23:28:23	jfhbrook	at any rate, I've considered doing what I think a lot of people do at one point or another, which is to write my own CI server
2015-02-16 23:28:33	jfhbrook	I'd be a huge asshole about it though
2015-02-16 23:28:40	jfhbrook	I want to be able to commit build plans to git
2015-02-16 23:28:48	jfhbrook	so the server would load js files
2015-02-16 23:28:59	jfhbrook	written using an EDSL for specifying build plans and hooks
2015-02-16 23:29:16	jfhbrook	optionally support coffeescript to crank the assholeishness to 11

2015-02-16 23:33:03	jfhbrook	ehh, there are a few bits and pieces that aren't great for shell scripts
2015-02-16 23:33:25	jfhbrook	but yes, you should absolutely be able to run a series of bash commands as a build step
2015-02-16 23:33:26	substack	you can write those in a different language
2015-02-16 23:33:33	jfhbrook	and any sane CI server (even jenkins) supports this

2015-02-16 23:34:00	jfhbrook	one is, you have to be able to trigger events on your server
2015-02-16 23:34:34	jfhbrook	and the easiest way to do that is by using the server's internal API---like, `buildServer.emit('myJob::build', options)`
2015-02-16 23:34:43	jfhbrook	like, you could shim in a cli tool to do that
2015-02-16 23:34:54	jfhbrook	or be a huge jerk and insist that it be triggered over curl only
2015-02-16 23:35:08	substack	"triggered" meaning a changes feed?
2015-02-16 23:35:22	jfhbrook	no, trigger meaning tell the server to start a build
2015-02-16 23:35:40	substack	oh yeah an http interface would be best for that
2015-02-16 23:36:00	jfhbrook	for instance, in jenkins, a build can be triggered manually via an http interface, or it can be configured to poll a repo for changes and trigger a build when changes happen
2015-02-16 23:36:17	jfhbrook	or a successful build can trigger a different build
2015-02-16 23:36:42	substack	that polling or github webhooks interface can just live outside the ci server itself
2015-02-16 23:36:44	jfhbrook	for instance---and jenkins doesn't support this well---if my CI build succeeds and the latest commit is tagged, upload an artifact to S3 and trigger a staging build

2015-02-16 23:37:20	jfhbrook	you also have to support creating temporary workspaces that clean up after themselves when the build is done
2015-02-16 23:37:42	jfhbrook	without making the user do this on their own every time
2015-02-16 23:38:10	substack	that's what /tmp is for
2015-02-16 23:38:12	jfhbrook	these workspaces also set up environment variables
2015-02-16 23:38:24	jfhbrook	tmp is where the workspace goes, yes
2015-02-16 23:38:46	jfhbrook	but tmp in and of itself doesn't create a folder, get you an environment with pwd in that tmp folder, and then rm -rf it when the build signals it's done
2015-02-16 23:39:12	jfhbrook	I have code that does this inside wzrd.in that's pretty extensive
2015-02-16 23:39:40	jfhbrook	some of that is because I wanted in-js fs helpers scoped to that directory, sort of a poor man's chroot
2015-02-16 23:40:23	jfhbrook	keep in mind that's a shitty metaphor
2015-02-16 23:40:30	jfhbrook	because you still get access to globally installed tools
2015-02-16 23:41:03	substack	docker containers would be good for that
2015-02-16 23:41:05	jfhbrook	you could probably get around that pretty well by writing a cli tool specifically for creating tmp folders with subshells
2015-02-16 23:41:08	substack	except for all the exploits lately
2015-02-16 23:41:18	jfhbrook	they might be, I think that would be overengineering

2015-02-16 23:42:14	jfhbrook	is the word I wanted
2015-02-16 23:43:45	jfhbrook	oh, jenkins also gives you cool charts/graphs/analytics ootb on your test results, the plugins slurp xml formatted test results (there are plugins that do this the sane way, with tap) and generate html graphs and such

2015-02-16 23:50:07	substack	stdin as test output (tap, xml, whatever) and stdout as html
2015-02-16 23:50:31	substack	and reports are just shell scripts like everything else
2015-02-16 23:51:15	substack	and the config would live in the repo itself
2015-02-16 23:51:28	substack	so changes to the scripts can be tracked along with the code
2015-02-16 23:52:28	jfhbrook	what would this look like?
2015-02-16 23:52:36	jfhbrook	I'm assuming you have a directory structure like
2015-02-16 23:52:41	jfhbrook	./my-project/build.sh
2015-02-16 23:53:36	jfhbrook	I guess if you wanted to be a HUGE asshole you could make your ci server just speak cgi
2015-02-16 23:53:47	substack	I would put the scripts in bin/ (sh or js or whatever) and have a json file for package.json scripts field style lifecycle hooks
2015-02-16 23:54:00	jfhbrook	ah but package.json lifecycle scripts aren't general enough
2015-02-16 23:54:00	substack	but you could put the scripts wherever you want
2015-02-16 23:54:27	substack	what are they missing?
2015-02-16 23:54:46	jfhbrook	so like, they're very specific to npm
2015-02-16 23:55:01	substack	"style"
2015-02-16 23:55:02	jfhbrook	you might not have a build that fits the install/test/publish pattern
2015-02-16 23:55:11	substack	not necessarily package.json, it would probably be a different file
2015-02-16 23:55:16	substack	but in that style
2015-02-16 23:55:42	jfhbrook	I agree that json is vastly superior to xml for configuration, though I'm skeptical of outside-defined lifecycle hooks
2015-02-16 23:55:55	jfhbrook	I think what you really want is a series of steps, where if a single step fails the whole thing fails
2015-02-16 23:56:03	jfhbrook	and you can define the steps however you like
2015-02-16 23:56:06	jfhbrook	possibly something like,
2015-02-16 23:56:31	substack	what about a "scripts" field where the values could be arrays?
2015-02-16 23:56:37	substack	and would basically work like &&
2015-02-16 23:56:40	jfhbrook	yeah that was what I was about to suggest
2015-02-16 23:56:42	substack	or maybe just && would be adequate
2015-02-16 23:57:25	jfhbrook	I still think a javascript dsl would be more flexible but I like this as a thought experiment
2015-02-16 23:57:45	jfhbrook	plus, speccing builds in coffeescript would be really funny
2015-02-16 23:58:29	substack	you could have an api that looks like a dsl but it would hook into the exposed http interface
2015-02-16 23:59:23	jfhbrook	I was thinking more like a bizarro mashup between mocha and gulp
2015-02-17 00:00:59	jfhbrook	the angrier it makes you the better
2015-02-17 00:01:33	substack	I think shoehorning all build output and assets through stdout would be fun
2015-02-17 00:01:48	substack	if you want to save multiple files you could tar to stdout
2015-02-17 00:02:29	jfhbrook	one nice thing about build artifacts is you *can* offload that to the user
2015-02-17 00:02:49	jfhbrook	scp it, rsync it, POST it to s3, whatever, bash solves that problem nicely
2015-02-17 00:03:00	jfhbrook	hell, cp it to /var/www/builds

2015-02-23 15:03:52	mikolalysenko	streaming parsing for small things like markdown or (most) source files is a waste of time
2015-02-23 15:04:17	mikolalysenko	that is maybe a bold assertion, but I think that it is not a good idea as it makes things much more complicated and slower

2015-02-23 15:05:10	mikolalysenko	it might be debatable if a streaming api is more composable than a sync api, but many grammars are filled with productions like matching braces/blocks that force you to glob everything anyway
2015-02-23 15:05:32	mikolalysenko	that said there are things where streaming is sensible and a good idea, like csv parsing for example
2015-02-23 15:06:43	mikolalysenko	but this doesn't apply to programming languages where you often have nested blocks of blocks of state that all has to be buffered/tokenized anyway

2015-03-03 10:27:20	tixz	When deploying an application people put stuff like connection strings, api keys, etc. different places. Some in json config files, others in environment variables. Config files that checked into git are as good as compromised, and environment variabels are not safe either. What's the "right" approach to this?

2015-03-06 01:43:34	kumavis	ogd: this is what i ended up doing https://github.com/kumavis/cryptographer
2015-03-06 01:44:01	kumavis	very open to criticism
2015-03-06 01:45:50	kumavis	it should be a little more transparent about what it is using under the hood, I'll get there
2015-03-06 01:47:55	domanic	kumavis, quite a bit extra stuff in the example that I don't need to know
2015-03-06 01:48:03	kumavis	yeah prolly
2015-03-06 01:48:07	domanic	like, the requirements and flow for the password
2015-03-06 01:48:14	kumavis	they do feel a bit bloated
2015-03-06 01:48:38	domanic	that code can just be a module, it doesn't need to be typed out in the example
2015-03-06 01:48:58	domanic	I had to read the first example, and didn't learn anything about your module
2015-03-06 01:49:35	kumavis	ok thanks
2015-03-06 01:50:06	domanic	what I need is a simple description of how it works, then a minimal example using it
2015-03-06 01:50:40	domanic	you should also say what algorithm it uses.
2015-03-06 01:57:20	kumavis	better? https://github.com/kumavis/cryptographer#-localstorage
2015-03-06 01:57:28	kumavis	domanic: ^
2015-03-06 01:58:19	shama	Does npm i glslify work for anyone else (io.js v1.4.3 and npm v2.6.1)? Or do you get "npm ERR! Failed to check out a41a40b49046747b3af57341cda048bbd3d9df79 error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:" too?
2015-03-06 01:58:54	kumavis	domanic: i really appreciate the feedback btw
2015-03-06 01:59:41	kumavis	readme still feels like a wall of text
2015-03-06 01:59:48	domanic	kumavis, yes
2015-03-06 02:00:26	domanic	kumavis, there are some aes settings you should NOT use
2015-03-06 02:00:35	domanic	I forget which, but did you check?
2015-03-06 02:01:10	kumavis	crypto friend helped me pick that particular one
2015-03-06 02:01:29	kumavis	not set in stone
2015-03-06 02:02:06	domanic	kumavis, hey, do you encrypt the keys?
2015-03-06 02:02:40	kumavis	domanic: we dont store the keys.. is this what you mean?
2015-03-06 02:02:46	kumavis	oh you mean the key-value keys
2015-03-06 02:02:53	domanic	yeah, kv keys
2015-03-06 02:03:00	kumavis	no, i was considering that
2015-03-06 02:03:15	kumavis	the question is then, how do we look them up again?
2015-03-06 02:03:17	domanic	you could just hmac them with the salt
2015-03-06 02:03:47	domanic	you couldn't iterate over them, but you don't have that api anyway

2015-03-06 02:04:16	null_radix	hiya :)
2015-03-06 02:04:36	kumavis	null_radix: dominc suggests at least hashing the key-value keys
2015-03-06 02:04:58	kumavis	this is a good idea
2015-03-06 02:05:05	null_radix	yep
2015-03-06 02:05:28	null_radix	you should just use a fast hash for that
2015-03-06 02:05:55	domanic	or the salt & password ... then the keys are as secure as the messages
2015-03-06 02:06:11	null_radix	matter a fact we are goign to hash all the keys in ethereum's trie for enhanced security has well
2015-03-06 02:06:49	null_radix	yeah that a good idea too
2015-03-06 02:08:55	null_radix	@kumavis; wdyt of providing an option as how you want to handle the keys?
2015-03-06 02:09:10	kumavis	nah i want it to just be secure by default
2015-03-06 02:09:34	null_radix	kk

2015-03-06 02:10:24	null_radix	so an instersting property of the keys is that they never change
2015-03-06 02:11:33	null_radix	AES-GCM mode protects against telling if the encypted data has changed or not.
2015-03-06 02:12:58	null_radix	so you could use something different i suppose
2015-03-06 02:13:02	null_radix	not sure yet

2015-03-06 02:33:20	kumavis	ok one problem i ran into with encrypting the keys is that we generate a bunch of random padding, so encrypting the same thing twice does not give you the same result
2015-03-06 02:33:25	domanic	who is the *threat* that it protects you against or not?
2015-03-06 02:34:30	domanic	kumavis, right - this is why i suggested hmac for the keys - it's only one way, but you can check whether you already have that value
2015-03-06 02:34:47	domanic	otherwise, you'd have to decrypt all the keys to check whether you have one particular one
2015-03-06 02:36:24	null_radix	yeah just metadata
2015-03-06 02:36:27	kumavis	yeah, or just encrypt with a set padding
2015-03-06 02:38:21	kumavis	any downside to encrypting the keys with a set padding and iv? does it leak info about the priv key?
2015-03-06 02:38:21	kumavis	i guess it could
2015-03-06 02:38:21	null_radix	padding doesn't matter
2015-03-06 02:38:21	null_radix	iv does
2015-03-06 02:38:21	null_radix	at least for AES-GCM
2015-03-06 02:39:24	domanic	kumavis, this is symmetrical encryption right? so it's not a private key, it's just a key.
2015-03-06 02:39:43	domanic	null_radix, kumavis is there a problem reusing the same key over and over?
2015-03-06 02:40:01	null_radix	no that should be fine
2015-03-06 02:41:00	domanic	null_radix, what about known plaintext attacks?
2015-03-06 02:42:13	-->	anvaka (~anvaka@216.243.14.92) has joined #stackvm
2015-03-06 02:42:19	null_radix	isn't that when the attack konw what the plain text is and he tries to tell if the encrypted text is the paintext or not?
2015-03-06 02:45:34	domanic	null_radix, yeah, and if you guess that you know the keystream.
2015-03-06 02:45:43	null_radix	rigth
2015-03-06 02:46:55	domanic	so if you randomly pad the messages you can't know guess the plain text (trusting the RNG)

2015-03-06 02:48:57	domanic	hmm, symmetric encryption is much harder to reason about than hashes
2015-03-06 02:50:02	null_radix	just hashes are nice :)
2015-03-06 02:50:21	domanic	hmm, retriving a key IS a known plaintext attack
2015-03-06 02:51:34	null_radix	oh rigth so i was wrong
2015-03-06 02:51:34	domanic	you already know the key, and you just want to check whether the database has that key in it.

2015-03-06 02:53:51	domanic	null_radix, yes that is what I suggested ;)
2015-03-06 02:53:57	null_radix	rad
2015-03-06 02:54:04	kumavis	so hmac'ing keys via "SHA-1", "SHA-256", "SHA-384", or "SHA-512"
2015-03-06 02:54:14	kumavis	take your pic
2015-03-06 02:54:15	domanic	hash them with salt + password

2015-03-06 02:54:23	domanic	kumavis, anything but sha1
2015-03-06 02:55:28	domanic	oh, you are bcrypting your password, so you can just hmac the key with bcrypt(password)
2015-03-06 02:58:28	domanic	kumavis, why not sha1: https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/10/when_will_we_se.html

2015-03-06 02:59:18	kumavis	domanic: when you say hmac do you mean hash, or specifically hmac ?
2015-03-06 02:59:57	kumavis	i guess i am not familiar with hmac and what it provides compared to a generic hash
2015-03-06 03:03:41	domanic	kumavis, it's just a way of combining hashes that prevents length extension attacks

2015-03-07 03:15:07	pfraze	yeah, it's very elegant
2015-03-07 03:15:34	domanic	and you can see the clustering too
2015-03-07 03:15:43	domanic	depending on how you order the nodes
2015-03-07 03:17:07	domanic	like, in the example, you can instantly see the friends of valjean, and the friends of friends of valjean
2015-03-07 03:17:18	domanic	who are not friends of valjean
2015-03-07 03:17:36	domanic	and which nodes are in both camps

2015-03-07 03:27:35	domanic	pfraze, you could also label the edge direction with arrow heads (at either end) and label or color code the edges also

2015-03-07 03:28:07	pfraze	domanic: yeah, i bet you could make a decent UI around one of those graphs
2015-03-07 03:30:35	domanic	pfraze, the only question is how to order the nodes.
2015-03-07 03:33:47	pfraze	domanic: I suppose you can chose any property you want
2015-03-07 03:35:04	domanic	yeah, I guess you start with a some central node (i.e. YOU) and then nodes that are linked to from there
2015-03-07 03:43:11	domanic	and since it's only ever one line per column, it's simple to label the edges (if necessary) by vertically aligning that label
2015-03-07 03:44:12	domanic	I had graph stuff that i wanted to experiment with, that I left undone because I didn't want to start another fascinating computer science problem (graph layout)
