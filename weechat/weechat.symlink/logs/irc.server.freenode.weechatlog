2015-01-23 04:32:06	--	- Over the weekend of 13th-14th September freenode staff noticed
2015-01-23 04:32:06	--	- some compromised binaries present on a number of servers.
2015-01-23 04:32:06	--	- The servers in question have been removed from the network and
2015-01-23 04:32:06	--	- shut down.  However, it's possible that network traffic  -
2015-01-23 04:32:06	--	- including SSL traffic - has been sniffed and passwords
2015-01-23 04:32:06	--	- exposed.
2015-01-23 04:32:06	--	-
2015-01-23 04:32:06	--	- We therefore recommend that all users change their nickserv

2015-01-24 12:53:26	--	- Over the weekend of 13th-14th September freenode staff noticed

2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	-
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	- Over the weekend of 13th-14th September freenode staff noticed
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	- some compromised binaries present on a number of servers.
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	- The servers in question have been removed from the network and
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	- shut down.  However, it's possible that network traffic  -
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	- including SSL traffic - has been sniffed and passwords
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	- exposed.
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	-
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	- We therefore recommend that all users change their nickserv
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	- password(s) to a new value which is not shared with any
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	- other service.
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	-
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	- You can do this with /msg nickserv set password newpasshere
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	-
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	- Please note that investigation is ongoing to discover the root
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	- cause of the attack, and until this investigation is complete
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	- we cannot be 100% certain that all traces of the compromises
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	- have been removed. We may have to ask you to change your
2015-01-26 04:13:35	--	- passwords again after analysis has completed.

2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- England, Sir Alfred Hitchcock was a noted film director
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- and producer. Over a long career he pioneered many modern
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- techniques in film-making, made more than 50 feature films,
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- and influenced many present-day directors and producers.

2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	-                       SECURITY ALERT
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	-
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- Over the weekend of 13th-14th September freenode staff noticed
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- some compromised binaries present on a number of servers.
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- The servers in question have been removed from the network and
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- shut down.  However, it's possible that network traffic  -
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- including SSL traffic - has been sniffed and passwords
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- exposed.
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	-
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- We therefore recommend that all users change their nickserv
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- password(s) to a new value which is not shared with any
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- other service.
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	-
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- You can do this with /msg nickserv set password newpasshere
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	-
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- Please note that investigation is ongoing to discover the root
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- cause of the attack, and until this investigation is complete
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- we cannot be 100% certain that all traces of the compromises
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- have been removed. We may have to ask you to change your
2015-01-28 09:20:33	--	- passwords again after analysis has completed.

2015-01-28 19:40:23	--	- Over the weekend of 13th-14th September freenode staff noticed
2015-01-28 19:40:23	--	- some compromised binaries present on a number of servers.
2015-01-28 19:40:23	--	- The servers in question have been removed from the network and
2015-01-28 19:40:23	--	- shut down.  However, it's possible that network traffic  -
2015-01-28 19:40:23	--	- including SSL traffic - has been sniffed and passwords
2015-01-28 19:40:23	--	- exposed.
2015-01-28 19:40:23	--	-
2015-01-28 19:40:23	--	- We therefore recommend that all users change their nickserv

2015-01-28 19:40:23	--	- other service.
2015-01-28 19:40:23	--	-

2015-02-01 14:20:10	--	- Over the weekend of 13th-14th September freenode staff noticed
2015-02-01 14:20:10	--	- some compromised binaries present on a number of servers.
2015-02-01 14:20:10	--	- The servers in question have been removed from the network and
2015-02-01 14:20:10	--	- shut down.  However, it's possible that network traffic  -
2015-02-01 14:20:10	--	- including SSL traffic - has been sniffed and passwords

2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	-
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	- Over the weekend of 13th-14th September freenode staff noticed
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	- some compromised binaries present on a number of servers.
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	- The servers in question have been removed from the network and
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	- shut down.  However, it's possible that network traffic  -
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	- including SSL traffic - has been sniffed and passwords
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	- exposed.
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	-
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	- We therefore recommend that all users change their nickserv
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	- password(s) to a new value which is not shared with any
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	- other service.
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	-
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	- You can do this with /msg nickserv set password newpasshere
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	-
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	- Please note that investigation is ongoing to discover the root
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	- cause of the attack, and until this investigation is complete
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	- we cannot be 100% certain that all traces of the compromises
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	- have been removed. We may have to ask you to change your
2015-02-02 01:07:59	--	- passwords again after analysis has completed.

2015-02-03 07:58:00	--	-
2015-02-03 07:58:00	--	- Over the weekend of 13th-14th September freenode staff noticed
2015-02-03 07:58:00	--	- some compromised binaries present on a number of servers.
2015-02-03 07:58:00	--	- The servers in question have been removed from the network and
2015-02-03 07:58:00	--	- shut down.  However, it's possible that network traffic  -
2015-02-03 07:58:00	--	- including SSL traffic - has been sniffed and passwords
2015-02-03 07:58:00	--	- exposed.
2015-02-03 07:58:00	--	-
2015-02-03 07:58:00	--	- We therefore recommend that all users change their nickserv

2015-02-19 01:34:41	--	-
2015-02-19 01:34:41	--	- Over the weekend of 13th-14th September freenode staff noticed
2015-02-19 01:34:41	--	- some compromised binaries present on a number of servers.
2015-02-19 01:34:41	--	- The servers in question have been removed from the network and
2015-02-19 01:34:41	--	- shut down.  However, it's possible that network traffic  -
2015-02-19 01:34:41	--	- including SSL traffic - has been sniffed and passwords

2015-02-19 01:34:41	--	-
2015-02-19 01:34:41	--	- We therefore recommend that all users change their nickserv
2015-02-19 01:34:41	--	- password(s) to a new value which is not shared with any
2015-02-19 01:34:41	--	- other service.
2015-02-19 01:34:41	--	-
