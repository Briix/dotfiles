2015-01-21 01:40:09	@mafintosh	karissa: --dataset is probably not a good idea since its always required
2015-01-21 01:40:18	karissa	that makes sense
2015-01-21 01:40:47	@mafintosh	oh you mean have both?
2015-01-21 01:40:59	karissa	mafintosh: yeah, maybe
2015-01-21 01:41:11	karissa	mafintosh: i think its hard to tell because we haven't seen how people might use this on the command line
2015-01-21 01:41:22	@mafintosh	the *stateful* one makes scripting a bit hard

2015-01-21 01:58:03	karissa	here's a working draft https://github.com/datproject/website/issues/21
2015-01-21 02:00:56	@mafintosh	karissa: i'm thinking we should have a dat repl at some point as well - that should definitely have the stateful datsets command
2015-01-21 02:01:04	karissa	alright
2015-01-21 02:01:08	karissa	makes sense!
2015-01-21 02:02:46	karissa	mafintosh: i'm not sure i'm completely ecstatic about the commandline interface we came up with but i'm not sure i'm finding anything better in my experimentation
2015-01-21 02:03:03	@mafintosh	karissa: yea i feel the same way
2015-01-21 02:03:53	@mafintosh	karissa: i really like the node api me and ogd did today though - its more low level than the cli api is gonna be (no import etc) but maybe we can get some new inspiration from that
2015-01-21 02:04:13	karissa	awesome
2015-01-21 02:04:22	karissa	yeah it should be more low level than the cli
2015-01-21 02:04:25	karissa	sounds good
2015-01-21 02:04:40	karissa	i was looking at it and thought it looked good

2015-01-23 20:11:24	karissa	as far as column types+descriptions+readmes all being indexed
2015-01-23 20:11:35	@ogd	i put all of npm in it and it seemed okay
2015-01-23 20:11:41	@ogd	super fast queries
2015-01-23 20:11:44	karissa	i mean w/ the change feed
2015-01-23 20:11:54	@ogd	well that would just turn into sql insert statements
2015-01-23 20:12:15	@ogd	i cant imagine we would be inserting fast enough in the conceivable future
2015-01-23 20:12:22	karissa	k
2015-01-23 20:12:24	@ogd	cause it will mostly be readme edits and metadat creation

2015-01-26 00:38:11	@ogd	erikg: so at least we will be able to have multiple datasets in the same dat after beta. probably what you were asking about is more like HTTP API/auth/ACLs etc im guessing and the answer there is we have it on the roadmap but im unsure when we are tackling it
2015-01-26 00:39:32	@ogd	erikg: we are also splitting out all the HTTP server stuff from dat into a separate thing, one of the benefits there is that it will encourage people to write custom dat server wrappers

2015-02-11 02:12:36	kemitchell	oops
2015-02-11 02:13:26	kemitchell	I guess I can start with a general question, then. I have some data sources that don't have much output, but post updates very regularly, often by FTP. NASDAQ is an example; they post a text file of the companies' securities being traded every day.
2015-02-11 02:13:48	kemitchell	It's small enough to pass around as a JSON file, but there will be many, slightly different, versions.

2015-02-11 02:17:39	@ogd	kemitchell: hmm interesting idea
2015-02-11 02:18:42	@ogd	kemitchell: so if you can make a gasket pipeline for your data import process then you could use dat as a devDependency
2015-02-11 02:18:53	@ogd	kemitchell: so the only setup needed would be to clone a thing, run npm install and npm start
2015-02-11 02:19:15	@ogd	let me try and find an example
2015-02-11 02:19:23	kemitchell	ogd: Thanks so much.

2015-02-11 02:20:54	@ogd	kemitchell: that way people dont have to do npm i gasket -g if they dont want to
2015-02-11 02:21:27	@ogd	kemitchell: weve also talked about writing something that runs a gasket pipeline on a timer (e.g. cron job) but havent tackled that yet
2015-02-11 02:22:14	kemitchell	ogd: The cron job would package a snapshot for npm, or have some other effect?
2015-02-11 02:22:46	@ogd	kemitchell: sorry, it would just run some import pipeline/job
2015-02-11 02:22:53	kemitchell	ogd: Ah. I follow.
2015-02-11 02:22:53	@ogd	kemitchell: i havent thought about packaging for npm w/ any of this
2015-02-11 02:23:51	@ogd	kemitchell: so you are thinking of shipping a standalone CLI tool that used dat internally?

2015-02-11 02:24:33	kemitchell	ogd: Fundamentally, I guess my issue is twofold. Many of these sources use ancient, home-rolled text file formats that nobody else should have to figure out again. Second, they're not currently storing history.
2015-02-11 02:25:03	kemitchell	ogd: Long story short, they should be using dat. They won't.
2015-02-11 02:25:50	kemitchell	ogd: I'd be very happy to contribute (or extract) more general tools. That would be awesome.
2015-02-11 02:26:06	kemitchell	ogd: To give a sense of a more immediate goal...
2015-02-11 02:26:43	@ogd	kemitchell: yea maybe think about writing up a use case issue https://github.com/maxogden/dat/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22use+case%22
2015-02-11 02:26:54	@ogd	kemitchell: (the more detail the better :P_
2015-02-11 02:26:55	@ogd	)
2015-02-11 02:27:18	kemitchell	ogd: I'd like to write an npm module that scans would-be form contracts for potentially confidential information. One dead give-away is including a company's name in text that's going to be shared.
2015-02-11 02:27:49	kemitchell	There is a limited universe of valid company names at any given time. The better states have databases, which I'd like to scrape. Other sources, like the stock exchanges, also keep lists.
2015-02-11 02:28:52	kemitchell	org: The algorithm is generic, but the quality of output depends on having a good list of "red flag" strings and a sense of how they might appear non-verbatim.
2015-02-11 02:30:01	kemitchell	ogd: Oops, misspelled your nick on my last line.
2015-02-11 02:30:11	@ogd	kemitchell: gotcha. i think the more unixy you can get w/ your toolbuilding the better. we're trying to design dat w/ unix pipeline workflows in mind
2015-02-11 02:30:27	kemitchell	ogd: Amen, brother.
2015-02-11 02:31:11	kemitchell	ogd: A tool to ping "the source" on a regular basis and push into dat seems like the right linkages on that end.
2015-02-11 02:31:38	kemitchell	ogd: It's the last hop to the "consuming" npm package I'm not sure how to approach.
2015-02-11 02:31:46	kemitchell	ogd: Thanks again for reading along.

I was listening to a podcast interview of someone who works in public radio/public media and a lot of the themes resonated with what we are trying to do, which got me wondering why we dont use the word 'public' more in the same way that it is used in the e.g. public radio context

2015-02-18 18:15:43	@ogd	ryan_ramage: so the idea is to process each row of incoming ndjson, use level-inc (w/ memdown by default) to calculate sums of each key, and then when *all* input data is processed then read out all the keys?
2015-02-18 18:16:28	ryan_ramage	yes. thats it?it does have to wait for all?
2015-02-18 18:16:40	@ogd	ryan_ramage: gotcha, just clarifying i read the code correctly

2015-02-18 18:17:33	@ogd	i think https://www.npmjs.com/package/duplexify woudl be useful here
2015-02-18 18:18:13	@ogd	ryan_ramage: also i'd vote to call it simply https://www.npmjs.com/reduce-group instead :)

2015-02-18 18:20:10	ryan_ramage	and renaming?yes I guess the ndjson just adds bulk to the name

2015-02-19 14:52:11	erikg	mafintosh: so i went off into the wilderness and made a graph database in c++ using rocksdb. it stores directed graphs which have chunks of data in them. i use strings and align sequences to them, but any data type could be possible. i've been thinking of what else i might be able to apply it to other than DNA variation, and i was reminded of hyperlog.
2015-02-19 14:54:02	erikg	but i'm worried now that i've painted myself into a corner. there is an indexing scheme but it's not very general. it's focused at finding sequences in the graph (concatenations of sequences in the nodes, specifically).
2015-02-19 14:54:32	@mafintosh	erikg: sounds interesting. is it on github?
2015-02-19 14:54:34	erikg	it's https://github.com/ekg/vg
2015-02-19 14:54:47	@mafintosh	erikg: i was also in the wilderness last week coding graph databases!
2015-02-19 14:54:51	erikg	ahaha
2015-02-19 14:55:26	erikg	mafintosh: did you post your results as well?
2015-02-19 14:55:52	@mafintosh	erikg: not yet - still finishing it up. its gonna be v3 of hyperlog
2015-02-19 14:56:41	@mafintosh	i made some small tweaks to replication that allows for live replication
2015-02-19 14:57:13	@mafintosh	and changed the on-disk format a bit (some small optimizations)
2015-02-19 14:57:59	@mafintosh	erikg: we should do a hangout soon so i can show you the progress + how it integrates with dat

2015-02-19 14:58:38	erikg	mafintosh: i think that'd be great, i'm really curious where you've taken things
2015-02-19 14:59:56	@mafintosh	erikg: would sunday around noon utc work for you?
2015-02-19 15:01:01	erikg	mafintosh: yeah, let's do that
2015-02-19 15:01:19	@mafintosh	erikg: awesome. i'll send you an invite later today
2015-02-19 15:01:24	erikg	thanx
2015-02-19 15:01:27	@mafintosh	erikg: does vg have replication build in?
2015-02-19 15:03:17	erikg	mafintosh: nope, and i haven't even planned it yet
2015-02-19 15:03:32	erikg	the focus has been on high-performance queries of the space of sequences in a variation graph
2015-02-19 15:04:26	erikg	but in the medium term, there is a big interest in sharing genomic data, and i'd imagine it's easier to run live replication on dbs as they grow into the 10s of Ts
2015-02-19 15:04:59	-->	floppy (~floppy@62.254.247.134) has joined #dat
2015-02-19 15:05:30	erikg	i keep feeling that i need to build a general-purpose indexing and db pattern and rebase on that
2015-02-19 15:07:25	@mafintosh	erikg: we've actually done some work into general-purpose indexing recently, https://github.com/mafintosh/level-indexer
2015-02-19 15:08:27	@mafintosh	erikg: the idea is that you should always have a *local* changes-feed and that's how stuff like indexing will integrate with your database
2015-02-19 15:09:18	erikg	mafintosh: this is really nice
2015-02-19 15:09:38	erikg	i may replicate this in C++
2015-02-19 15:09:45	@mafintosh	nice.
2015-02-19 15:10:01	@mafintosh	its a nice decoupling pattern
2015-02-19 15:10:08	erikg	it is
2015-02-19 15:10:27	erikg	so any system that makes a changes feed can be integrated, no?
2015-02-19 15:10:29	@mafintosh	this way people can write their own indexing strategies as well without us having to bloat core
2015-02-19 15:10:33	@mafintosh	yea!
2015-02-19 15:10:58	-->	sfkeller (~chatzilla@152.96.214.230) has joined #dat
2015-02-19 15:11:02	@mafintosh	and the changes feed only need to be local ordered so its pretty easy to implement
2015-02-19 15:11:35	@mafintosh	hyperlog exposes a local changes feed as well for this reason, https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperlog#changesstream--logcreatechangesstreamoptions
2015-02-19 15:11:37	erikg	mafintosh: what's the local ordering property for?
2015-02-19 15:12:01	erikg	mafintosh: is the changes feed a protobuf stream?
2015-02-19 15:12:06	@mafintosh	erikg: so you can resume indexing if you crash
2015-02-19 15:12:53	erikg	ah
2015-02-19 15:13:04	erikg	i had these problems with protobufs
2015-02-19 15:13:05	@mafintosh	erikg: yea. its just a stream of binary values + a change index. you should know how to decode the binary value (since that is database specific)
2015-02-19 15:13:14	erikg	ok
2015-02-19 15:13:21	erikg	i exceeded the maximum size of a protobuf object
2015-02-19 15:13:38	@mafintosh	oh? how big was it?
2015-02-19 15:13:42	erikg	64mb
2015-02-19 15:14:18	erikg	something iternally is in danger of overflow
2015-02-19 15:14:22	erikg	damn 32-bit integers
2015-02-19 15:14:43	erikg	so protobuf shouts and requires you to chunk the object somehow
2015-02-19 15:14:52	@mafintosh	hah
2015-02-19 15:15:25	erikg	leading me to write a kind of compressed file format for arbitrary pb objects: https://github.com/ekg/vg/blob/master/stream.hpp
2015-02-19 15:15:27	@mafintosh	yea a lot of things in protobuf are length prefixed so i could see how thats a problem when using big objects
2015-02-19 15:15:35	erikg	yup
2015-02-19 15:16:59	@mafintosh	couldn't they just use a bigger integer type?
2015-02-19 15:18:01	erikg	or maybe a varint. i actually don't understand the internals very much.
2015-02-19 15:18:06	erikg	i also ran into a problem with leveldb
2015-02-19 15:18:09	erikg	er, sorry

2015-02-19 15:18:31	@mafintosh	leveldb can only store pretty small objects
2015-02-19 15:18:38	@mafintosh	like <5mb or something
2015-02-19 15:18:42	erikg	woa
2015-02-19 15:19:30	erikg	https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/513
2015-02-19 15:20:11	@mafintosh	the workaround is storing them externally in a content-addressable-blob-store and just storing the hash in leveldb
2015-02-19 15:20:24	erikg	so the problem with rocksdb is that you have to use what they call "level style" compaction if your db is bigger than about 100G
2015-02-19 15:20:52	erikg	mafintosh: yep, which also makes sense because you can put the blobs anywhere
2015-02-19 15:21:05	@mafintosh	they don't do any snappy-like compaction for you?

2015-03-04 12:59:01	Gaboose	Hello everybody
2015-03-04 12:59:13	Gaboose	so our system generates gigabites of plain text log files
2015-03-04 12:59:57	Gaboose	most of them have timestamps
2015-03-04 13:00:14	Gaboose	i'd like to browse them online real-time
2015-03-04 13:00:35	Gaboose	or after a week or so
2015-03-04 13:00:57	Gaboose	do yo think dat can help out in that kind of use case
2015-03-04 13:05:24	Gaboose	i'd like some cool ui features, like browsing by the timestamp, but at the least Dat should be able to handle large data uploads better than git, right?
2015-03-04 13:10:06	yoshuawuyts	Gaboose: it does sound like a good fit

2015-03-05 00:05:28	@ogd	mafintosh: ah
2015-03-05 00:05:52	@ogd	mafintosh: maybe have a separate decoder stream

2015-03-05 00:21:34	@mafintosh	ogd: alright changesdown 2.3.0 adds .createChangesStream that decodes and is friendly to use, https://github.com/mafintosh/changesdown#stream--dbcreatechangesstreamopts
2015-03-05 00:22:00	@ogd	mafintosh: good question
2015-03-05 00:22:03	@ogd	mafintosh: ok cool ill try it out
2015-03-05 00:23:33	@mafintosh	ogd: it doesn't do the 'always be arrays thing yet' but i thinks it way better than before :)

2015-03-05 01:07:08	jbenet	ogd: IMO http://datalad.org should merge effort into dat mainline
2015-03-05 01:07:16	jbenet	ogd: http://datalad.org/pages/about.html <-- NSF and others funded.
2015-03-05 01:07:51	jbenet	not sure if you've talked to them, but i think that dat (+ maybe some blobs on ipfs) will solve their problems better than git
2015-03-05 01:08:04	jbenet	and looks like they just want to solve problems, not necessarily married to git

2015-03-06 01:35:41	mikolalysenko	ogd: for binary xhrs, is there any way to get it to give you partial arraybuffer chunks?
2015-03-06 01:35:48	mikolalysenko	the current behavior in chrome is kind of bad
2015-03-06 01:35:51	@ogd	mikolalysenko: no its one big arraybuffer
2015-03-06 01:35:58	@ogd	mikolalysenko: onreadystatechange 3 notifies you when it gets appended to
2015-03-06 01:36:02	mikolalysenko	yeah
2015-03-06 01:36:06	@ogd	mikolalysenko: but you cant split it across multiple arraybuffers
2015-03-06 01:36:11	mikolalysenko	but here is the problem it doesn't give me the partial array buffer
2015-03-06 01:36:14	@ogd	mikolalysenko: unless you use multiple http requests and range headers
2015-03-06 01:36:26	mikolalysenko	I am ok with one big array buffer, but it doesn't seem to do anything until it has fully loaded the buffer
2015-03-06 01:36:35	mikolalysenko	ready state change fires, but xhr.response is still null
2015-03-06 01:36:50	@ogd	mikolalysenko: ah yes, i think you have to have a certain content-type... lemme check
2015-03-06 01:37:04	mikolalysenko	ah, figured there was a secret code
2015-03-06 01:39:04	@ogd	mikolalysenko: bah i cant remember how... but i know you can access xhr.response as it fills up...
2015-03-06 01:39:13	@ogd	also im not sure its xhr.response, i think it was another property
2015-03-06 01:39:26	@ogd	oh wait yea it is, the other one is xhr.responseText i think
2015-03-06 01:40:17	mikolalysenko	but responseText is a string right?
2015-03-06 01:40:37	mikolalysenko	I want a binary buffer, not a string
2015-03-06 01:40:54	@ogd	mikolalysenko: i understand, im just trying to remember what all the crappy xhr properties and settings do
2015-03-06 01:41:15	mikolalysenko	yeah, I am more whining out of the unfairness of it all
2015-03-06 01:41:34	@ogd	mikolalysenko: you set xhr.responseType = 'arraybuffer' right
2015-03-06 01:41:43	mikolalysenko	yep
2015-03-06 01:41:51	mikolalysenko	I get the progress events and everything
2015-03-06 01:42:03	mikolalysenko	but it doesn't give me the final array buffer until it gets to readyState 4
2015-03-06 01:42:18	mikolalysenko	which is a little useless for me, since I want to load things progressively
2015-03-06 01:43:11	mikolalysenko	hmm
2015-03-06 01:43:12	mikolalysenko	https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/chromium-html5/UAN_6LibEwk
2015-03-06 01:43:15	mikolalysenko	this looks bad
2015-03-06 01:43:31	mikolalysenko	but it is from 3 years ago
2015-03-06 01:46:29	@ogd	mikolalysenko: whats the response content-type, just curious
2015-03-06 01:46:44	@ogd	mikolalysenko:  i seem to remember that making a difference, e.g. try 'application/octet-stream'
2015-03-06 01:46:53	mikolalysenko	ok, I'll try it
2015-03-06 01:47:05	mikolalysenko	it is a binary blob mesh, serving it using beefy
2015-03-06 01:49:12	mikolalysenko	nope, didn't solve it
2015-03-06 01:49:30	mikolalysenko	I think that is necessary if you use responseText though
2015-03-06 01:49:38	mikolalysenko	maybe it would be easier to push it via a binary websocket
2015-03-06 01:52:38	@ogd	mikolalysenko: its been ~2 years since ive tests this behavior, i wouldnt be surprised if they changed it in chrome
2015-03-06 01:53:03	@ogd	mikolalysenko: actually...
2015-03-06 01:53:12	@ogd	mikolalysenko: maybe i am misremembering
2015-03-06 01:53:23	@ogd	mikolalysenko: i think you have always had to wait for arraybuffer
2015-03-06 01:53:32	@ogd	mikolalysenko: but responseText is available the entire time
2015-03-06 01:53:43	@ogd	mikolalysenko: yeahhhhh okay thats it, i had just forgotten
2015-03-06 01:53:55	mikolalysenko	why would they do that... why
2015-03-06 01:54:05	mikolalysenko	:(
2015-03-06 01:54:42	mikolalysenko	I mean wasn't there this big deal about xhr2 and how it is gonna solve all the problems with xhr and make life great?
2015-03-06 01:55:31	@ogd	i think the octet-stream content type affects whether or not you get 1 readystate 3 or multiple when using responseText
2015-03-06 01:55:34	@ogd	or something stupid like that
2015-03-06 02:23:18	@mafintosh	ogd, mikolalysenko FF used to have a thing where you could send back the response as multipart/form-data and read them as chunks in the licent

2015-03-06 23:41:12	@mafintosh	ogd: yes you have to drain it using .resume() OR in the above case just don't call the callback with a work result
2015-03-06 23:41:27	@ogd	mafintosh: ah right so its the users responsibility
2015-03-06 23:41:31	@mafintosh	yea
2015-03-06 23:41:52	@mafintosh	ogd: turns out denmark DOES fit in memory, https://twitter.com/mafintosh/status/573976417815379969
2015-03-06 23:41:58	@ogd	lol
2015-03-06 23:43:29	@mafintosh	ogd: maybe the atomicQueue could have a way to get a stream of all unfinished work as well
2015-03-06 23:44:14	@ogd	mafintosh: im assuming that fits in memory
2015-03-06 23:44:24	@ogd	mafintosh: though maybe i could write it to the db first
2015-03-06 23:44:25	@mafintosh	ogd: ah nice
2015-03-06 23:44:51	@ogd	mafintosh: right now i store everything in one value
2015-03-06 23:44:52	@mafintosh	ogd: well in the transform stream case it probably doesn't fit in memory
2015-03-06 23:45:16	@mafintosh	ogd: since it will contain the entire work queue
2015-03-06 23:45:52	@ogd	mafintosh: im not following... if its a stream it has to fit in memory
2015-03-06 23:49:06	@mafintosh	ogd: in my transform stream example... you first write ALL the work to the queue (this will be written to a leveldb)
2015-03-06 23:49:47	@mafintosh	ogd: then the transform stream "worker" processes the work and (possibly) pushes the result to the readable part
2015-03-06 23:49:55	@ogd	mafintosh: ah ok
2015-03-06 23:50:14	@mafintosh	ogd: so the work that is written to leveldb is probably not gonna fit in memory
2015-03-06 23:50:23	@ogd	mafintosh: what happens if you .write some stuff and it crashes, how do you restart
2015-03-06 23:50:34	@ogd	(e.g. how do you know as the data provider which data to re-write)
2015-03-06 23:51:01	@mafintosh	ogd: there should be a way to peek at the unfinished work in the queue
2015-03-06 23:51:21	@mafintosh	ogd: like queue.peek(function(err, latestAdded) { ... })
2015-03-06 23:51:43	@mafintosh	or .head maybe
2015-03-06 23:51:45	@ogd	good idea
2015-03-06 23:51:53	@ogd	i currently get that on startup
2015-03-06 23:52:09	@ogd	so i could expose it as a property
2015-03-06 23:52:29	@mafintosh	ogd: yea good idea
2015-03-06 23:52:42	@mafintosh	ogd: and emit an 'ready' event i guess?
2015-03-06 23:52:52	@mafintosh	since you get it async i presume
2015-03-06 23:53:05	@ogd	yea
2015-03-06 23:54:31	@mafintosh	i enjoy writing tests more and more :)

2015-03-06 23:55:27	@mafintosh	... man if the travis badge would show how many tests you had i'm pretty i would go test crazy!
2015-03-06 23:55:49	@ogd	ooooh
2015-03-06 23:55:56	@ogd	or like... ratio of code vs tests
2015-03-06 23:57:38	@mafintosh	ogd: yea thats probably simpler to implement even

2015-03-07 21:06:02	@ogd	mafintosh: i wonder if it would make sense to have a module that is essentially through2 but where all state is stored in leveldb

2015-03-07 21:06:58	@mafintosh	ogd: thats more or less the atomicQueue interface i wrote in my gist i think right?
2015-03-07 21:07:31	@ogd	mafintosh: well sort of
2015-03-07 21:07:49	@ogd	mafintosh: my queue has a concurrency, i was thinking a more primitive thing would just be a writable stream that was synced to disk
2015-03-07 21:08:02	@ogd	mafintosh: but im not sure if, when you write data to the stream you need a callback when its synced
2015-03-07 21:08:18	@ogd	mafintosh: e.g. nonstandard stream api like  writable.write({foo: 'bar'}, cb)
2015-03-07 21:08:44	@mafintosh	ogd: writable.write has a callback in streams2
2015-03-07 21:08:49	@ogd	oh haha

2015-03-07 22:33:26	@mafintosh	ogd: i'm playing around with building docker images on top of difffs and putting them in a hyperlog graph (to do efficient docker deploys)
2015-03-07 22:34:30	@mafintosh	ogd: and i'm realizing that there a bunch of use-cases for being able to run dat in 'graph-only' mode. i.e. don't be a key-value store - just a graph
2015-03-07 22:35:36	@mafintosh	ogd: not sure if this is plausible - just something to think about
2015-03-07 22:35:46	@mafintosh	karissa: also o/
2015-03-07 22:53:03	@ogd	mafintosh: how do you put stuff in a graph without a key value store
2015-03-07 22:53:10	@ogd	mafintosh: also just published v2.0.0 of https://github.com/maxogden/atomic-queue
2015-03-07 22:53:43	@mafintosh	ogd: value+links (links are a list of hashes of previous nodes)
2015-03-07 22:55:06	@mafintosh	ogd: like graph.add(links, value, cb) -> {key: 'a hash', value:value, links:links}
2015-03-07 22:55:10	@ogd	mafintosh: hmm i'd have to see the complete api to get what you're saying i think. what do you lose by including the k/v parts?
2015-03-07 22:56:21	@mafintosh	ogd: fx in the the docker deploy case i don't want a key value store - i just want a graph of 'file system' commits
2015-03-07 22:57:10	@ogd	mafintosh: what would 'graph-only' mode be? a different module?
2015-03-07 22:58:03	@mafintosh	ogd: this i'm not sure about - it would still be nice to have blobs etc
2015-03-07 22:58:49	@mafintosh	ogd: the graph only api is more or less, https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperlog
2015-03-07 23:02:34	@mafintosh	ogd: atomic-queue 2.0 looks sweet btw
2015-03-07 23:05:54	--	xat- is now known as xAt
2015-03-07 23:06:53	@ogd	mafintosh: there are undocumented features like if your worker calls cb with (err, data) then i call readable.push(data), but only if data !== undefined
2015-03-07 23:07:27	@ogd	mafintosh: also i wanna make it so you can pass your own pool in. right now it just uses the same worker fn for each pool member
2015-03-07 23:07:44	@ogd	mafintosh: but if i let you pass in an array then it would solve that, and you could roll your own multiprocess junk on top of it
2015-03-07 23:08:39	@mafintosh	ogd: the cb(null, data) thing is like regular through2 so it's not super surprising
2015-03-07 23:09:25	@ogd	mafintosh: also i decided the worker fn should be (data, cb, change)
2015-03-07 23:09:36	@ogd	mafintosh: that way you can just use (data, cb) if you dont need the full change data
2015-03-07 23:09:43	@ogd	mafintosh: and data is just change.value.value
2015-03-07 23:11:32	@mafintosh	ogd: makes sense
2015-03-07 23:11:36	@ogd	mafintosh: hey i think you need brfs in protocol-buffers

2015-03-07 23:11:54	@ogd	mafintosh: 'undefined is not a function' after bundling + executing in a browser
2015-03-07 23:12:08	@mafintosh	ogd: instead of https://github.com/maxogden/atomic-queue/blob/master/index.js#L90-L92 you should just use the changes-feed directly and not use changesdown at all
2015-03-07 23:12:28	@ogd	mafintosh: oh yea good idea, that is kinda hacky
2015-03-07 23:12:33	@mafintosh	ogd: ah you mean in brfs in changesdown?

2015-03-07 23:14:23	@mafintosh	ogd: fixed
2015-03-07 23:15:38	@mafintosh	ogd: got time tomorrow for a screenhero? wanna showcase/discuss some of the graph stuff
2015-03-07 23:15:44	@ogd	mafintosh: yea
2015-03-07 23:15:49	@mafintosh	nice
2015-03-07 23:16:04	@mafintosh	ogd: i'm finishing up live replication as we speak :)
2015-03-07 23:16:33	@ogd	awesomeness
2015-03-07 23:16:59	@ogd	karissa: cc o/ in case you're interested in the nitty gritty
2015-03-07 23:29:58	@mafintosh	ogd: we could make a thing thats basically just atomicQueue but distributed using dat as the state layer
2015-03-07 23:31:42	@ogd	mafintosh: yea i was just thinking about that
2015-03-07 23:32:48	@mafintosh	atomic-queue is a pretty sweet name actually
2015-03-07 23:34:36	@mafintosh	ogd: in live replication - should both the remote and local stream agree to replicate live or is it enough if one of them wants to?
2015-03-07 23:47:39	@ogd	mafintosh: 1 way should be ok imo, thats a 'pull' right?
2015-03-07 23:47:49	@ogd	as opposed to 'sync'
2015-03-07 23:49:39	@mafintosh	ogd: yea - you're gonna be able to live push as well
2015-03-07 23:49:50	@mafintosh	and live sync (both ways)
2015-03-08 00:04:47	@mafintosh	live replication now works in the graph layer \o/
2015-03-08 00:06:38	@ogd	woot
2015-03-08 00:12:09	erikg	mafintosh: we should discuss aligning big graphs
2015-03-08 00:12:28	erikg	And the data I have can be in record form
2015-03-08 00:12:44	erikg	It's actually more fun to think about it that way
2015-03-08 00:13:16	@mafintosh	erikg: what do you mean by aligning graphs?
2015-03-08 00:13:51	erikg	mafintosh: describing the relationship between two diverged graphs
2015-03-08 00:13:59	erikg	Is alignment
2015-03-08 00:14:24	@mafintosh	erikg: ah right!
2015-03-08 00:14:29	erikg	Merging is the same operation in your graphs
2015-03-08 00:14:39	erikg	But now I have to sleep :)
2015-03-08 00:14:42	@mafintosh	lol
2015-03-08 00:14:56	@mafintosh	erikg: we should do another hangout soon

2015-03-08 00:21:02	erikg	mafintosh: definitely. Sometime later this coming week? I will try to grok hyperlog.
2015-03-08 00:22:38	@mafintosh	erikg: yea - i can do more or less any time next week so just ping me when you're available
