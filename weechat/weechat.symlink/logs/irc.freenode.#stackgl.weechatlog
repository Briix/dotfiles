2015-01-13 17:12:12	mattdesl	ugh. i feel like es6 import/export is gonna take a while to get used to
2015-01-13 17:20:56	pyrotechnick	es6 is too late to the party
2015-01-13 17:22:28	billautomata	how long do you think we'll be polyfilling es6 in the browser?
2015-01-13 17:23:06	mattdesl	billautomata - polyfilling, you mean Promise / Array / String stuff? maybe a while. i still polyfill Array.map on some projects :\
2015-01-13 17:23:45	pyrotechnick	thanks apple
2015-01-13 17:24:02	mattdesl	pyrotechnick - es6 is indeed too late but only because npm / commonJS has taken off very well. if es6 was a little more commonJS-friendly i think it would be adopted much quicker
2015-01-13 17:24:14	pyrotechnick	it will be eventually
2015-01-13 17:24:17	pyrotechnick	that's how these things go
2015-01-13 17:24:19	billautomata	just dealing with incomplete/inconsistent implementations across browsers
2015-01-13 17:24:42	pyrotechnick	but afaik there's 0 compelling reasons to ever use it
2015-01-13 17:24:49	mattdesl	billautomata - 6to5 and other transpilers are pretty complete for most ES6 features
2015-01-13 17:25:14	pyrotechnick	if you're doing something radican like competing with node for instance
2015-01-13 17:25:18	billautomata	I guess I'm wondering when we are going to be able to shed any doubt of it all breaking down because some transpiler doesn't like the use of some new feature
2015-01-13 17:25:27	pyrotechnick	then there's alot of hipster cred you could gain from using it
2015-01-13 17:25:30	pyrotechnick	that's about it
2015-01-13 17:25:41	billautomata	I'm lamenting that I like these features, but I'll never use them in production
2015-01-13 17:25:45	mattdesl	billautomata - if you target IE10+ you should already be good to go. the real problems will crop up with things like module/cjs inter-op
2015-01-13 17:26:27	mattdesl	pyrotechnick - been using es6 lately on demos / projects. some things are much needed, like arrow function and string templates
2015-01-13 17:27:03	mattdesl	`list.map( x => x * x )` etc
2015-01-13 17:28:25	pyrotechnick	i write coffee so
2015-01-13 17:28:31	pyrotechnick	welcome to the party
2015-01-13 17:29:09	mattdesl	lol
2015-01-13 17:39:51	pyrotechnick	es6 was basically an exercise in deciding how far they should push js towards coffee
2015-01-13 17:40:03	pyrotechnick	turns out: all the way
2015-01-13 17:58:25	yoshuawuyts	haha, so true
2015-01-13 18:01:35	yoshuawuyts	best part of es6 imo is fat arrow functions & generators. Oh and const ofc.
2015-01-13 18:02:11	yoshuawuyts	Don't like all the OO stuff they put in there, just adds a lot of cruft to the language.

2015-01-13 18:03:28	mattdesl	yeah i?m already seeing situations where people are encouraging APIs that use ?extend? / ?super? etc :(
2015-01-13 18:03:42	yoshuawuyts	mattdesl: do you use es6 imports through 6to5?
2015-01-13 18:04:02	mattdesl	not yet. just 6to5 for the syntax sugar, commonjs requires
2015-01-13 18:04:21	yoshuawuyts	wait, what. We have `extend` / `super`  now?
2015-01-13 18:04:23	mattdesl	is this even possible with es6? require(?foo?)({ ? } )
2015-01-13 18:05:06	mattdesl	yoshuawuyts yeah, although it?s just syntax sugar for prototypical inheritance which makes things even more murky and fragile if you use those features to design software
2015-01-13 18:05:27	yoshuawuyts	oh god, that's such a shit idea
2015-01-13 18:07:27	yoshuawuyts	wish JS took more from Haskell rather than from Java
2015-01-13 18:08:39	yoshuawuyts	mattdesl have you seen spiderlang? http://spiderlang.org/
2015-01-13 18:08:41	mattdesl	yeah never understood why so many features are influenced by java. i came from Java, it was ?ok? but seems so far behind in regards to modern concepts like FP, package managers, etc
2015-01-13 18:09:40	mattdesl	never tried spider
2015-01-13 18:10:41	yoshuawuyts	I guess familiarity plays huge parts. Reason Rust is stuck with a piece of shit package manager is also because Ruby people joined the team without having ever really tried npm (alledgedly).
2015-01-13 18:10:48	yoshuawuyts	me neither, but the channels part looks pretty neat
2015-01-13 18:11:04	yoshuawuyts	seems like a better solution than promises
2015-01-13 18:11:11	yoshuawuyts	or async / await for that matter
2015-01-13 18:12:38	mattdesl	so many semicolons ! ha
2015-01-13 18:13:32	pyrotechnick	yoshuawuyts: this is really nice
2015-01-13 18:13:45	yoshuawuyts	ooh, it also has pattern matching! :o Didn't catch that before.
2015-01-13 18:18:37	pyrotechnick	Channels can be used everywhere: UI abstraction, Node.js services (e.g: Mailing List)
2015-01-13 18:18:39	pyrotechnick	wtf does that mean?

2015-01-19 00:56:20	QF-MichaelK	I was thinking of doing some curves stuff (splines or bezier).  I think doing this on the cpu may not be necessary, but I don't know how to do this sort of thing on the gpu without tessellation.  Thoughts?

2015-01-22 01:54:26	QF-MichaelK	mikolalysenko: Why can you require an array (as you did with data.json) for a texture, but can't require a png...?
2015-01-22 01:56:48	@mikolalysenko	QF-MichaelK: you could turn it into a buffer, but you wouldn't get an image object
2015-01-22 01:56:56	@mikolalysenko	if you want that, you could try ndarray-pack-image
2015-01-22 01:57:17	@mikolalysenko	it might be a good beginner project to turn that into a browserify transform
2015-01-22 01:58:05	@mikolalysenko	https://www.npmjs.com/package/ndpack-image
2015-01-22 02:01:36	QF-MichaelK	Ah, interesting

2015-01-23 01:41:35	@mikolalysenko	QF-MichaelK: you need to include glslify as a browserify transform
2015-01-23 01:41:39	@mikolalysenko	or you can use brfs
2015-01-23 01:41:59	QF-MichaelK	How?

2015-01-23 01:42:18	@mikolalysenko	you can either pass a flag to beefy (or preferred) stick a field in your package.json file
2015-01-23 01:43:53	QF-MichaelK	  "browserify": { "transform": ["glslify"] ...?
2015-01-23 01:44:17	@mikolalysenko	yep, that should work!
2015-01-23 01:44:31	QF-MichaelK	then require or fs?
2015-01-23 01:44:48	@mikolalysenko	?
2015-01-23 01:45:19	@mikolalysenko	if you are using glslify, in a browser the preferred behavior is to use it as a transform

2015-01-26 15:28:41	@mikolalysenko	QF-MichaelK: ah, algebraic sets are way too hard
2015-01-26 15:29:15	@mikolalysenko	doing it right is an enormous pita, much easier to just subdivide them into piecewise linear cell complexes
2015-01-26 15:30:24	@mikolalysenko	I think my next big geometry project is going to be rounding exact precision cell complexes to finite precision floats
2015-01-26 15:30:37	@mikolalysenko	probably some kind of variant on snap rounding
2015-01-26 15:31:05	@mikolalysenko	and then after that any dimensional csg/minkowski operations
2015-01-26 15:31:23	@mikolalysenko	(on simplicial complexes)

2015-01-26 21:12:35	QF-MichaelK	I can do deCasteljau's or deBoor's algorithm, but the problem is it'd all be cpu without the tessellation shader the way I can think of it.   Woot minkowski!!!!
2015-01-26 21:16:49	QF-MichaelK	mikolalysenko: I've been looking for some curved surfaces, I suppose you can dynamically do it when needed based off of the control points.
2015-01-26 21:16:58	QF-MichaelK	Then you're storing far less information
2015-01-26 21:17:22	QF-MichaelK	Depending on the degree, well, it might not be so bad.
2015-01-26 21:26:38	@mikolalysenko	QF-MichaelK: the trouble with using algebraic sets, like splines is that it is much much harder to do operations on them robustly
2015-01-26 21:26:46	@mikolalysenko	also you need to tessellate them anyway for the purposes of drawing
2015-01-26 21:27:29	@mikolalysenko	the main advantage in doing operations directly on algebraic sets is not really storing, but for editing purposes
2015-01-26 21:27:46	@mikolalysenko	sometimes you want to directly edit trim curves in CAD applications, for things like feature based modeling
2015-01-26 21:28:07	@mikolalysenko	however for games and graphical applications it is totally overkill
2015-01-26 21:28:12	@mikolalysenko	just use piecewise linear sets
2015-01-26 21:29:17	QF-MichaelK	mikolalysenko: It'd be more to practice curved surfaces for quals
2015-01-26 21:29:36	QF-MichaelK	But, I suppose I should just do it by hand to "practice"
2015-01-26 21:34:20	@mikolalysenko	most approaches to curved surfaces boil down to root finding or algebraic methods, like cylindrical algebraic decomposition
2015-01-26 21:34:28	@mikolalysenko	or grobner basis
2015-01-26 21:34:40	QF-MichaelK	It'd most likely be the two I mentioned
2015-01-26 21:34:47	QF-MichaelK	splines and bezier

2015-01-26 21:34:55	QF-MichaelK	for the ones I'd be messing with
2015-01-26 21:38:54	@mikolalysenko	intersection problems === root finding
2015-01-26 21:39:20	@mikolalysenko	the real problem is the algorithms for doing all that stuff are error prone and difficult to implement
2015-01-26 21:39:27	@mikolalysenko	or slow and practically useless
2015-01-26 21:40:22	QF-MichaelK	I don't see where the intersections would be.
2015-01-26 21:40:30	QF-MichaelK	It's just subdivision
2015-01-26 21:44:01	@mikolalysenko	ok, I guess it depends what you are doing
2015-01-26 21:44:17	@mikolalysenko	if you are just rendering surfaces it is usually enough to subdivide
2015-01-26 21:44:25	@mikolalysenko	but for csg you need to intersect, same for ray tracing
2015-01-26 21:44:42	@mikolalysenko	and pretty much everything else out there involving manipulation of solids
2015-01-26 21:45:57	QF-MichaelK	Hm, good point
2015-01-26 21:46:14	QF-MichaelK	ex: someone walking on a bezier landscape
2015-01-26 21:46:48	@mikolalysenko	the reason meshes are popular is that intersections of piecewise linear sets === solve a linear system
2015-01-26 21:46:56	@mikolalysenko	which is pretty fast and can be done exactly
2015-01-26 21:48:02	QF-MichaelK	Hm, but there are ways to solve with bezier... It's just more tricky, you start with convex hulls, then break it up into subcomponents if there is a collision.
2015-01-26 21:48:53	QF-MichaelK	But maybe not worth doing if this has to stay in a buffer
2015-01-26 21:49:34	@mikolalysenko	that is one way

2015-01-26 21:49:50	@mikolalysenko	but generally it reduces to root finding, either by bisection or whatever

2015-01-26 22:28:46	QF-MichaelK	So, I made a simple demo 2 different ways: raw webgl all one file, then using browserify to break it up...  I'd like to do a version with stackgl, but not quite sure how to do the migration.

2015-02-03 23:54:15	billautomata	I feel really stupid for not having thought about this before, but this article (http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/performance/mystery/) says that arithmetic operations cause heap allocations and I was wondering how y'all dealt with that in particle systems especially when using libraries that do a lot of this behind the scenes?  I have some good code causing some heavy GC and I'm curious if there are any silver bulle
2015-02-03 23:54:15	billautomata	ts for particle systems beyond having big typedarrays and staying in them
2015-02-03 23:54:57	billautomata	also is zero GC in a particle system a feasible goal?
2015-02-03 23:55:26	@mikolalysenko	billautomata: certainly, using typed arrays
2015-02-03 23:55:43	@mikolalysenko	also for optimized code it won't allocate stuff on the heap
2015-02-03 23:56:02	@mikolalysenko	but you need to make sure that your code plays by the rules to prevent v8 from doing extra allocations
2015-02-03 23:56:37	billautomata	okay that is something I read but didn't have an understanding of until now, if V8 can optimize, it doesn't matter what happens in the function it will do it quickly
2015-02-03 23:57:19	billautomata	m = (10* 0.8) * a; // won't cause heap allocation if the function itself is optimized by V8 properly
2015-02-03 23:57:47	@mikolalysenko	right
2015-02-03 23:57:57	billautomata	okay, time to get really familiar with that then, thank you
2015-02-03 23:58:16	@mikolalysenko	but it is true that double number types are stored in the heap, not in a register, by default
2015-02-03 23:58:26	@mikolalysenko	unless the optimizer kicks in
2015-02-03 23:58:57	@mikolalysenko	though this is a general pattern, where if your code isn't getting optimized by v8 it will probably have performance problems
2015-02-04 00:00:05	@mikolalysenko	you can also use arrays of doubles, but there is a bit of a trick to getting the optimization to work right
2015-02-04 00:00:15	@mikolalysenko	it helps to initialize the array to a float value like 0.5 instead of 0
2015-02-04 00:00:30	@mikolalysenko	since 0 will get coerced to a small int instead of a double
2015-02-04 00:01:18	billautomata	where is the V8 optimization book?
2015-02-04 00:02:03	billautomata	https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/wiki/Optimization-killers just tons of articles like this
2015-02-04 00:02:05	@mikolalysenko	it isn't a book, more a collection of knowledge which is changing as v8 evolves
2015-02-04 00:02:14	@mikolalysenko	that one is pretty good
2015-02-04 00:03:46	@mikolalysenko	anyway, the best way to avoid this problem is to just not use custom vector types and stick to arrays

2015-02-04 21:11:50	@mikolalysenko	hughsk__: mattdesl hacking on camera controls!   https://mikolalysenko.github.io/turntable-camera-controller/
2015-02-04 21:11:57	@mikolalysenko	still really rough, but I think it is promising!
2015-02-04 21:12:12	mattdesl	nice, that feels smooth
2015-02-04 21:12:56	@mikolalysenko	yeah, I was shocked how well it worked
2015-02-04 21:13:05	@mikolalysenko	but the complexity required to do it is a little insane...
2015-02-04 21:13:15	@mikolalysenko	I think it should be possible to modularize it away though
2015-02-04 21:13:23	@mikolalysenko	so we will have a nice, smooth default camera controller
2015-02-04 21:13:44	mattdesl	looking at code.. i don?t see ?mousedown? events? or am i blind?
2015-02-04 21:13:50	@mikolalysenko	no, it only uses mousemove
2015-02-04 21:14:06	mattdesl	hmm how does that work? it only moves for me on click + drag
2015-02-04 21:14:18	@mikolalysenko	like I said, it is a little insane
2015-02-04 21:14:24	mattdesl	lol
2015-02-04 21:14:26	jules__	thats cool
2015-02-04 21:14:37	mattdesl	some sort of browser sorcery?
2015-02-04 21:14:37	jules__	nice trick with e.which
2015-02-04 21:14:52	mattdesl	ah
2015-02-04 21:14:52	mattdesl	sneaky
2015-02-04 21:14:56	@mikolalysenko	it requires interaction with the raf too
2015-02-04 21:15:16	@mikolalysenko	this will all get hidden away behind some wrapper module
2015-02-04 21:15:25	@mikolalysenko	or maybe a few layers of wrappers...
2015-02-04 21:15:35	mattdesl	yeah.. been trying to do tween based modules. i don?t like having multiple rafs going off in my final loop
2015-02-04 21:15:44	@mikolalysenko	probably there will be one more "mega camera" module
2015-02-04 21:15:58	@mikolalysenko	and a new version of game-shell/gl-now which exposes a default camera
2015-02-04 21:16:23	@mikolalysenko	sort of a quick one-shot webgl setup + camera creation gadget
2015-02-04 21:16:27	mattdesl	also touch is a bit of a nightmare if you want it to feel good and filter out secondary/tertiary fingers
2015-02-04 21:16:33	@mikolalysenko	yeah
2015-02-04 21:16:41	mattdesl	as i found out: https://github.com/Jam3/touches
2015-02-04 21:16:42	@mikolalysenko	exactly my thinking in packaging up a mega camera module
2015-02-04 21:17:04	@mikolalysenko	I started working on a module called "easy-camera" as opposed to a simple camera
2015-02-04 21:17:21	@mikolalysenko	but easy is important for getting started and ramping up projects
2015-02-04 21:17:50	@mikolalysenko	and I think that in this case it is warranted as 1). no one likes to think about cameras, and 2) you can still drill down and split the whole thing apart if you like
2015-02-04 21:18:58	mattdesl	yup that?s my feeling lately. get things working first, and then drill down later if the optimizations or tweaks are actually necessary
2015-02-04 21:19:33	@mikolalysenko	yeah
2015-02-04 21:20:27	@mikolalysenko	the easy camera module will handle combined perspective/ortho projections and also wrap several lower level controllers
2015-02-04 21:20:32	@mikolalysenko	like turntable, orbit and fps
2015-02-04 21:20:41	mattdesl	cool. that sounds pretty ideal
2015-02-04 21:21:01	@mikolalysenko	yeah, it should be possible to do stuff like switch between one camera mode or another smoothly
2015-02-04 21:21:12	@mikolalysenko	and each of those features would be implemented as separate modules
2015-02-04 21:21:31	@mikolalysenko	so if you decide you don't want this huge camera thing, you can just pull it apart and grab the bits you want
2015-02-04 21:21:56	@mikolalysenko	or even bin it and build your own using direct matrix arithmetic (which is how it pretty much works right now)
2015-02-04 21:22:25	mattdesl	regarding raf loops. my high level stuff sometimes runs its own raf loop.. but the lower level ?drilled down? stuff just exposes a tick(dt) or update(dt) method.
2015-02-04 21:23:29	@mikolalysenko	I think event emitters are good for raf loops

2015-02-06 11:26:23	eZallDay	Looking for advice. Currently working on an importer for the new system. Importing the stuff thru the legacy REST API and considering how best to import some of the embed stuff in xmltext.
2015-02-06 11:28:59	eZallDay	My idea so far is so parse the field value in search of an content-view-embed class and extract the file path/image directly, tho I feel there might be a better way
2015-02-06 11:48:02	eZallDay	Anyone? :)
2015-02-06 12:30:25	yoshuawuyts1	eZallDay: wish I could help, but I've got no idea haha

2015-02-08 00:15:25	@mikolalysenko	sort of a bikeshed:  https://github.com/mikolalysenko/simple-heap
2015-02-08 00:29:17	substack	mikolalysenko: what do you think about cameras having a .tick() method instead of listening for a 'tick' event on a passed-in game shell object?
2015-02-08 00:29:43	@mikolalysenko	substack: not sure what you mean
2015-02-08 00:30:49	substack	camera.tick(dt, ev) is less coupled to a game engine implementation than shell.on('tick', function () {})
2015-02-08 00:31:02	substack	looking at game-shell-orbit-camera/camera.js
2015-02-08 00:31:31	substack	then you can use something like frame-loop to drive the simulation loop for example
2015-02-08 00:33:12	substack	the .tick() approach seems to lend itself better to smooth rotations since cameras can interpolate based on rotational acceleration and velocity more easily with a dt
2015-02-08 00:34:59	@mikolalysenko	yeah, eventually that is how it will work
2015-02-08 00:35:09	@mikolalysenko	also orbit-camera doesn't hook tick or anything
2015-02-08 00:35:23	@mikolalysenko	game-shell-orbit-camera is orbit-camera with convenience stuff to hook input handling
2015-02-08 00:35:37	@mikolalysenko	though instead of using relative time coordinates it will use absolute time
2015-02-08 00:35:49	substack	oh perfect
2015-02-08 00:35:51	@mikolalysenko	I think dt is something of an antipatter, better to just pass t for animations
2015-02-08 00:36:15	@mikolalysenko	basically favor interpolation > integration
2015-02-08 00:42:07	QF-MichaelK	I like changing angular velocity instead of angular position for smoother camera rotation

2015-02-10 15:19:11	@mikolalysenko	also substack and whoever else is around
2015-02-10 15:19:29	@mikolalysenko	this is intended to be the input-agnostic core module
2015-02-10 15:20:10	@mikolalysenko	thinking a bit about how to handle times here
2015-02-10 15:21:06	@mikolalysenko	at the moment, I am thinking that this module would read the wall clock time and use this for applying interpolation
2015-02-10 15:22:05	yoshuawuyts1	mikolalysenko: the interface looks simple, I like it.
2015-02-10 15:22:32	yoshuawuyts1	mikolalysenko: usually not so good with all things 3d, but think I can wrap my head around this module

2015-02-10 20:07:51	@hughsk	mikolalysenko: yeah, agree it makes more sense leaving the model matrix out there. maybe `shader.uniforms.dataToClip = camera.data.toClip(model)` might work?
2015-02-10 20:08:11	@mikolalysenko	what about making a stripped down version that just does the view matrix stuff?
2015-02-10 20:08:40	@mikolalysenko	like just a thing that mutliplexes over all the different view camera controllers
2015-02-10 20:08:50	@mikolalysenko	and handles keeping them in sync and dispatching methods
2015-02-10 20:09:26	@hughsk	that sounds good! can have another thing which handles coordinating the proj/view/model matrices, keep it lean :)
2015-02-10 20:09:39	@mikolalysenko	yeah
2015-02-10 20:09:59	@mikolalysenko	I think I'll still leave the timing interactions to the user level too
2015-02-10 20:10:12	@mikolalysenko	following the convention of "modify by appending events"
2015-02-10 20:14:06	@mikolalysenko	so you would do something like:   camera.getMatrix(t, out)  to get the interpolated view matrix at time t
2015-02-10 20:17:59	@hughsk	but the `camera.getMatrix(t, out)` would be handled by another package, right? best leaving it to absolute values in "core" I think :)
2015-02-10 20:20:39	@mikolalysenko	right
2015-02-10 20:21:18	@mikolalysenko	the idea would be to have one general view interface which calls out to different controllers, like turntable, orbit, fps etc.
2015-02-10 20:21:34	@mikolalysenko	mutating the state of the view would proceed by applying timestamped updates
2015-02-10 20:21:54	@mikolalysenko	like view.rotate(t, dtheta, dphi)
2015-02-10 20:21:54	@mikolalysenko	or view.pan(t, dx, dy)
2015-02-10 20:22:01	@hughsk	ahh gotcha
2015-02-10 20:22:08	@hughsk	yeah that makes sense
2015-02-10 20:22:17	@mikolalysenko	that way you can interpolate between successive views
2015-02-10 20:22:32	@mikolalysenko	you would usually be rendering the state of the camera delayed by some amount
2015-02-10 20:22:54	@mikolalysenko	there would also be a convenience layer for all of this which hooks event handlers and does the time stamping for you using now()
2015-02-10 20:22:59	@mikolalysenko	err right-now
2015-02-10 20:23:23	@mikolalysenko	but the lower level interface would not hook any event listeners or deal with timing at all (ie you could run it in node/tape with no trouble)
2015-02-10 20:23:50	@hughsk	awesome :)
2015-02-10 20:24:00	@hughsk	another thing is handling input
2015-02-10 20:24:12	@mikolalysenko	right, there is andy hall's stuff with game-input
2015-02-10 20:24:26	@hughsk	like, how would we add support for a leap motion controller to a camera?
2015-02-10 20:24:29	@mikolalysenko	it looks ok, but this is one of those things that is really annoying and hard to get right
2015-02-10 20:24:48	@mikolalysenko	so the low level interface is camera controller independent
2015-02-10 20:25:11	@mikolalysenko	you just call methods with time stamped events, like .rotate(),  .translate(), .pan(), etc
2015-02-10 20:25:18	@mikolalysenko	and those can come from whatever input source you like
2015-02-10 20:25:50	@mikolalysenko	another interesting possibility is to maybe have some generic interface like .applyMatrix() which applies some incremental transformation
2015-02-10 20:26:05	@mikolalysenko	that would allow for very flexible interactions like in leap motion or touch displays
2015-02-10 20:26:14	@mikolalysenko	ie have pinch to zoom/rotate/translate
2015-02-10 20:26:42	@hughsk	perfect :D is there anything I can do to help out with this stuff?
2015-02-10 20:26:45	@mikolalysenko	with 3 fingers I think you can specify a rigid motion by tracking touch
2015-02-10 20:26:57	@mikolalysenko	feedback and talking it through is most helpful
2015-02-10 20:27:14	@mikolalysenko	though I still don't have a good handle on the touch/input event side of things
2015-02-10 20:27:25	@mikolalysenko	and then there is weird things like leap/gamepads/vr/etc...
2015-02-10 20:27:46	@mikolalysenko	man, I feel like I am going down some weird rabbit hole with all of this
2015-02-10 20:28:01	@mikolalysenko	cameras and input interactions seem like a black hole of complexity
2015-02-10 20:28:09	@hughsk	haha, yeah that's the best way of putting it
2015-02-10 20:28:27	@mikolalysenko	though it seems like other systems have similar problems
2015-02-10 20:28:43	@hughsk	I think best approach would be to keep it nice and simple/hookable, pretty much like you described just then :)
2015-02-10 20:28:48	@mikolalysenko	for example an informal survey of babylon js suggests that around 30% of their public classes have something to do with cameras/input
2015-02-10 20:28:59	@mikolalysenko	yeah
2015-02-10 20:29:05	@hughsk	wow
2015-02-10 20:29:07	@hughsk	can then just make some simple wrappers for alternative input, projections, etc.
2015-02-10 20:29:23	@hughsk	but I have an oculus/leap and would be more than happy to get that stuff working :D
2015-02-10 20:29:46	@mikolalysenko	yeah, that would be awesome
2015-02-10 20:29:53	@mikolalysenko	I would love to have a comprehensive solution
2015-02-10 20:30:13	@mikolalysenko	this is one of those areas which is usually the least fun part of writing 3d apps and getting it solved will make everyone's life easier
2015-02-10 20:30:50	@hughsk	totally agree, would be fantastic to get to a point where we can just drop it in

2015-02-10 20:31:50	@hughsk	but yeah, I think what you've got with camera-3d now is great ? any road blocks with alternative inputs etc. we can take care of as they come up
2015-02-10 20:33:02	@mikolalysenko	yeah, though I am thinking of maybe deconstructing camera-3d a bit and just doing only the view() parts of it
2015-02-10 20:33:18	@mikolalysenko	and also leaving the timing interactions in place
2015-02-10 20:33:44	@hughsk	oh yup, meant the view part of camera-3d that is :)
2015-02-10 20:34:09	@mikolalysenko	ok, going to spin off a separate module for that
2015-02-10 20:34:40	@hughsk	sounds good
2015-02-10 20:38:24	@mikolalysenko	also I want to think ahead a bit about how to do webvr
2015-02-10 20:38:35	@mikolalysenko	this should probably be handled at the projection layer
2015-02-10 20:44:12	@mikolalysenko	hughsk: here is a draft api for the view-only camera component:  https://github.com/mikolalysenko/3d-view
2015-02-10 20:44:44	@mikolalysenko	the notation is a little accessor heavy because it leaves the interpolation parameter to the user

2015-02-10 22:07:41	substack	mikolalysenko: I think it would be much better if tick() took the time as an argument
2015-02-10 22:08:40	substack	otherwise the time becomes an implicit parameter and it's hard to do things like have a pause button
2015-02-10 22:08:43	@mikolalysenko	yeah
2015-02-10 22:08:53	@mikolalysenko	the latest version of 3d-view doesn't even have a tick() any more
2015-02-10 22:09:03	@mikolalysenko	you have to pass the time parameter in for each property you ready
2015-02-10 22:09:11	@mikolalysenko	err each time you read a property
2015-02-10 22:13:36	substack	what was the reasoning behind why you think dt is an antipattern?
2015-02-10 22:13:41	substack	from a few days ago
2015-02-10 22:15:21	substack	it seems like dts would be better for handling a discontinuous simulation
2015-02-10 22:21:49	@mikolalysenko	it depends how you use it
2015-02-10 22:21:57	@mikolalysenko	but dt is susceptible to noise/rounding errors
2015-02-10 22:22:14	@mikolalysenko	ie you get nondeterminism depending on how big your dt is
2015-02-10 22:22:30	@mikolalysenko	for example integrating in 4 steps with dt = 0.25 is not the same as integrating in 1 step with dt=1
2015-02-10 22:23:16	@mikolalysenko	in general though extrapolating from observations is harder to do than interpolating between previous data
2015-02-10 22:23:45	@mikolalysenko	also using t it is no big deal to deal with discontinuities
2015-02-10 22:24:07	@mikolalysenko	you basically store a curve parameterized by time, but there is no requirement that such a curve is continuous
2015-02-10 22:26:04	@mikolalysenko	there are also a lot of neat things you can do with history/interpolation that are impossible or prohibitively difficult to do with dt based integration
2015-02-10 22:26:19	@mikolalysenko	this is an inspiring/aspirational article with some cool stuff:  http://forrestthewoods.com/the-tech-of-planetary-annihilation-chronocam/
2015-02-10 22:26:45	@mikolalysenko	also regarding dt, many games have movement bugs which are hard to reproduce because they are timestep sensitive
2015-02-10 22:27:02	@mikolalysenko	for example in quake 2 you could "spin jump" by setting your fps really low and turning your mouse
2015-02-10 22:27:08	@mikolalysenko	due to the way they integrated rotational motion
2015-02-10 22:28:58	@mikolalysenko	other games with bugs include super meatboy, where if your computer lags the game will glitch out and kill you
2015-02-10 22:29:03	@mikolalysenko	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4541374/2d-platformers-why-make-the-physics-dependent-on-the-framerate
2015-02-10 22:30:25	@mikolalysenko	also this article:  http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/ (though I don't always agree with everything that the author says)
2015-02-10 22:31:53	@mikolalysenko	the thing is you usually want a fixed time step for physics/animation/games
2015-02-10 22:32:06	@mikolalysenko	but you also want to be able to interpolate between frames to render smoother graphics
2015-02-10 22:32:18	@mikolalysenko	so this is where the use t over dt mantra applies
2015-02-10 22:32:44	@mikolalysenko	you run the game at whatever clock you like, then in-between ticks you draw animations at a much higher interpolated rate
2015-02-10 22:33:41	@mikolalysenko	of course this doesn't matter for all applications and you can sometimes do dumb time step dependent integration and get away with it

2015-02-10 23:57:57	@mikolalysenko	TatumCreative: the main issue is that using integration with variable timesteps is a source of lots of bugs
2015-02-10 23:58:13	@mikolalysenko	but it can be easier in some cases to ship with that vs implement interpolation
2015-02-10 23:58:22	TatumCreative	yeah, i can see that now after having read it, especially doing physics stuff
2015-02-10 23:58:23	@mikolalysenko	dt can also be faster since you can do in place updates of state
2015-02-10 23:58:45	@mikolalysenko	it kinds of depends on the application, but for most animations interpolation is the right thing
2015-02-10 23:59:08	@mikolalysenko	there are exceptions though, like particle simulations or things with thousands of moving objects
2015-02-10 23:59:11	TatumCreative	any time i've done physics type of work, it's been pretty fiddly, i can see how adding determinism to the system would be a good thing
2015-02-10 23:59:31	TatumCreative	yeah, most of my stuff probably wouldn't benefit from it as they are pretty small visualization systems
2015-02-10 23:59:48	@mikolalysenko	yeah, though it can make movement more fluid/responsive
2015-02-11 00:00:11	TatumCreative	I like the indeterminism for my small works :) Math.random()
2015-02-11 00:00:43	@mikolalysenko	one problem though is that sometimes things can break on systems with lower frame rates

2015-02-11 00:37:34	substack	I've nearly got the contact set computed for simplicial complex collisions
2015-02-11 00:38:55	@mikolalysenko	haven't looked much at the state of constraint solving for rigid body physics simulations lately
2015-02-11 00:39:12	@mikolalysenko	it is a very different beast than CAD constraint solving, since you need to do it interactively and over small time steps
2015-02-11 00:39:52	@hughsk	mikolalysenko substack: for adding people in an org to modules this is pretty nice https://github.com/repo-utils/npm-org-rights
2015-02-11 00:41:08	@mikolalysenko	need to take a look at this, probably useful for scijs too
2015-02-11 00:42:37	@mikolalysenko	substack: it seems like SPOOK uses projected gauss seidel, which I think is the most common solution
2015-02-11 00:42:52	@mikolalysenko	but again details are important and I don't know enough to say for sure that it is the best way to do it
2015-02-11 00:43:08	@mikolalysenko	usually I would try to get a pool of at lest 2-3 different approaches and maybe experiment with them
2015-02-11 00:43:44	substack	ok, well I will keep building out this solution but in such a way it will be easy to swap out a different approach
2015-02-11 00:44:09	@mikolalysenko	there are basically 2 big approaches to rigid body simulation:  DVI and DEM
2015-02-11 00:44:22	@mikolalysenko	DEM = discrete element method and it is the older solution
2015-02-11 00:44:31	@mikolalysenko	it basically simulates using penalty forces and small timesteps
2015-02-11 00:44:52	@mikolalysenko	for particles and some simulations it is actually quite efficient, and has a very fast integration step
2015-02-11 00:45:17	@mikolalysenko	the downside is that because constraints are modeled as potentials/forces in the DEM method, they are not always enforced perfectly and the system might take many iterations to converge
2015-02-11 00:45:24	@mikolalysenko	it also doesn't handle stacking or rigid bodies as well

2015-02-11 00:45:45	@mikolalysenko	DVI = discrete variational method and it uses lagrangian mechanics/gauss' principle of least constraint
2015-02-11 00:46:05	@mikolalysenko	constraints in DVI are explicitly modeled and solved, which makes it better at dealing with hard rigid body impacts or joints
2015-02-11 00:46:35	@mikolalysenko	but the downside is that solving the constraints is generally a linear/cone complementarity problem which is slower than just integrating a bunch of odes
2015-02-11 00:47:11	@mikolalysenko	or non-linear complementarity for some challenging constraints (though in practice one usually approximates these using a linear constraint)
2015-02-11 00:48:41	@mikolalysenko	I think DVI is the preferred solution for rigid body mechanics (or at least that is what box2d/bullet use)
2015-02-11 00:49:13	@mikolalysenko	while DEM is more popular in particle simulations, fluids and cloth stuff where the constraints and forces involved are more flexible

2015-02-12 23:42:33	stevenkane	that is for certain the approach I will take
2015-02-12 23:42:46	--	Channel created on Fri, 18 Jul 2014 20:22:30
2015-02-12 23:43:01	@mikolalysenko	I started doing this with these modules:  https://github.com/stackgl/glsl-specular-cook-torrance
2015-02-12 23:43:05	stevenkane	yup
2015-02-12 23:43:08	stevenkane	i read that code
2015-02-12 23:43:09	@mikolalysenko	but there is more room to go with this approach I believe
2015-02-12 23:43:10	stevenkane	makes sense the approach
2015-02-12 23:43:24	stevenkane	it seems like you want to declare materials
2015-02-12 23:43:28	stevenkane	as browserify bundles
2015-02-12 23:43:36	stevenkane	or some such thing
2015-02-12 23:43:43	@mikolalysenko	no, make material lighting computations functions
2015-02-12 23:43:47	@mikolalysenko	and use them with glslify
2015-02-12 23:43:57	@mikolalysenko	https://github.com/stackgl/glslify
2015-02-12 23:44:00	stevenkane	ehh my terminology was poor
2015-02-12 23:44:05	stevenkane	I have used glslofy
2015-02-12 23:44:09	stevenkane	it's the approach I will use
2015-02-12 23:44:11	@mikolalysenko	ah, got it
2015-02-12 23:44:17	stevenkane	but it's the declaration of these things I'm looking into
2015-02-12 23:44:23	stevenkane	like how to statically define a "material"
2015-02-12 23:44:39	@mikolalysenko	I wouldn't worry about that problem since it has no scope or real solution
2015-02-12 23:45:09	stevenkane	hrm
2015-02-12 23:45:11	stevenkane	not sure about that
2015-02-12 23:45:15	@mikolalysenko	but making functions for implementing specific lighting effects does have merit and will converge to something good I think
2015-02-12 23:45:18	stevenkane	I mean I see what you're driving at
2015-02-12 23:45:38	@mikolalysenko	I think if you try to build a giant one-size fits all material system it will end up being too inflexible, you'll end up with something like threejs/babylon
2015-02-12 23:45:41	stevenkane	ya I mean my approach to date has been to just build stuff
2015-02-12 23:45:44	stevenkane	programatticaly
2015-02-12 23:45:50	stevenkane	ya for certain NOT what I want
2015-02-12 23:45:50	@mikolalysenko	I think you should keep with that
2015-02-12 23:45:51	stevenkane	hahah
2015-02-12 23:46:01	stevenkane	the entire point of the problem is to avoid that
2015-02-12 23:46:12	@mikolalysenko	abstract out common pieces of shader functionality into modules
2015-02-12 23:46:21	stevenkane	the end goal is a PBR system that performs well
2015-02-12 23:46:30	stevenkane	ya
2015-02-12 23:46:40	stevenkane	it's the linkage between the useage of GLSL programs and CPU programs
2015-02-12 23:46:47	stevenkane	it's the definition of the gap between them
2015-02-12 23:46:52	stevenkane	that I am playing w/
2015-02-12 23:47:03	@mikolalysenko	have you looked at gl-shader?
2015-02-12 23:47:16	@mikolalysenko	https://github.com/stackgl/gl-shader
2015-02-12 23:47:44	stevenkane	ya
2015-02-12 23:47:54	stevenkane	I haven't wrapped as much gl stuff in my implementation
2015-02-12 23:48:00	stevenkane	i find the wrapping is a bit dubious
2015-02-12 23:48:12	stevenkane	as there is quite a large surface area of parameterization
2015-02-12 23:48:19	stevenkane	I have data structures similar to that tho
2015-02-12 23:48:29	@mikolalysenko	so you can use it to do stuff like:  shader.uniforms.myLight = { position: [0,0,0], color: [1,1,0,1], ... }
2015-02-12 23:48:33	stevenkane	do the refelction machinery to expose the defined attributes and uniforms
2015-02-12 23:48:34	stevenkane	ya
2015-02-12 23:48:48	stevenkane	ya it's easy enough to implement that stuff via setters/getters
2015-02-12 23:48:55	stevenkane	I'm just not sure I care about it
2015-02-12 23:49:00	stevenkane	it's still the same amount of coding
2015-02-12 23:49:25	stevenkane	but ya, that is the bridging I'm talking about though for sure
2015-02-12 23:49:40	@mikolalysenko	I find it reduces loc substantially for shader set up and configuration, but ymmv
2015-02-12 23:49:42	stevenkane	things like "specularity is either from THIS texture OR is of value "x"
2015-02-12 23:50:04	@mikolalysenko	why not specify stuff like that with code?
2015-02-12 23:50:07	@mikolalysenko	ie write a shader?
2015-02-12 23:50:17	@mikolalysenko	since you're gonna have arbitrarily complicated relations
2015-02-12 23:50:24	stevenkane	ya agree
2015-02-12 23:50:32	stevenkane	this is more or less why I pinged you guys
2015-02-12 23:50:36	stevenkane	to get your pulse on it
2015-02-12 23:50:42	stevenkane	I agree there is no generic solution
2015-02-12 23:51:00	stevenkane	your idea to modularize the code snippets
2015-02-12 23:51:04	stevenkane	is very worthwhile clearly
2015-02-12 23:51:15	stevenkane	and gl-shader has a more terse way to update shader values
2015-02-12 23:51:29	stevenkane	which is good I think provided it's completely encompassing and doesn't incur too much overhead
2015-02-12 23:51:41	stevenkane	which it probably doesn't (assuming getters/setters are inlineable?)
2015-02-12 23:51:45	@mikolalysenko	yeah
2015-02-12 23:51:50	@mikolalysenko	the run time overhead is small
2015-02-12 23:51:56	@mikolalysenko	no objects are created, everything is cached, etc.
2015-02-12 23:52:00	stevenkane	ya for sure
2015-02-12 23:52:03	stevenkane	btw
2015-02-12 23:52:06	stevenkane	this is off topic
2015-02-12 23:52:14	stevenkane	have you explored contiguous data strutures in js
2015-02-12 23:52:24	stevenkane	like polymorphic buffers ala structs in c etc
2015-02-12 23:52:32	stevenkane	I tested this extensively but was depressed w/ the results
2015-02-12 23:52:42	stevenkane	the buffer and DataView implementations are pretty damn slow
2015-02-12 23:52:57	@mikolalysenko	I tend to use typed array directly
2015-02-12 23:53:01	stevenkane	smae
2015-02-12 23:53:02	stevenkane	same
2015-02-12 23:53:03	@mikolalysenko	buffer/dataview are too much overhead
2015-02-12 23:53:07	stevenkane	it's much better optimized
2015-02-12 23:53:13	stevenkane	but it's not polymorohic
2015-02-12 23:53:18	stevenkane	which makes generalized solutions tough
2015-02-12 23:53:35	@mikolalysenko	you can make them, but it is more work
2015-02-12 23:53:39	stevenkane	hrm
2015-02-12 23:53:42	stevenkane	I tried a good deal
2015-02-12 23:53:49	stevenkane	couldn't overcome the CPU overhead
2015-02-12 23:53:56	@mikolalysenko	actually, got to go right now
2015-02-12 23:54:00	stevenkane	kk
2015-02-12 23:54:02	stevenkane	thanks for the input
2015-02-12 23:54:03	stevenkane	we'll have to chat
2015-02-12 23:54:08	stevenkane	I'm starting a 3d meetup in chicago
2015-02-12 23:54:12	stevenkane	maybe you can come talk
2015-02-12 23:58:31	@mikolalysenko	yeah, for sure
2015-02-12 23:58:42	@mikolalysenko	it's only like a 2 hour drive from here
2015-02-12 23:59:10	@mikolalysenko	used to get down there more often when my gf lived in indiana
2015-02-13 00:00:13	TatumCreative	i'm jealous of your big cities ;)
2015-02-13 00:00:33	stevenkane	ok we'll chat sometime soon
2015-02-13 00:00:33	TatumCreative	i don't know a single person doing webgl IRL
2015-02-13 00:00:44	stevenkane	I'm wanting to aim for a talk in mid March
2015-02-13 00:00:49	stevenkane	too much travel this month for me
2015-02-13 00:00:54	stevenkane	I'd really love you to come down though
2015-02-13 00:01:41	stevenkane	Tatum I live in Chicago and I also know 0 people that are webgl literate lol
2015-02-13 00:01:47	stevenkane	it's a super tiny niche at this point
2015-02-13 00:01:56	stevenkane	(I'm sure there are some out there I just don't know them)
2015-02-13 00:02:31	TatumCreative	yeah, we just need to do some badass stuff with it
2015-02-13 00:02:32	TatumCreative	:)
2015-02-13 00:02:42	TatumCreative	get some nice tools out there
2015-02-13 00:08:52	stevenkane	there is some nice demo-scene type stuff out there but honestly I have yet to see a single compelling application : /
2015-02-13 00:08:55	stevenkane	it's kinda sad to say that
2015-02-13 00:09:00	stevenkane	but it's true at least for me
2015-02-13 00:09:19	stevenkane	the tooling and pipelines are all custom/adhoc in most cases

2015-02-13 00:09:31	stevenkane	which I think limits the pool of participants to the truly explorative
2015-02-13 00:11:59	mattdesl	webgl is definitely picking up quite a bit since iOS8
2015-02-13 00:12:14	mattdesl	e.g. GoogleIO is using it on their 2015 site
2015-02-13 00:13:30	stevenkane	agree
2015-02-13 00:13:42	stevenkane	it feels sort of like "the right time" to be involved
2015-02-13 00:13:43	stevenkane	or something
2015-02-13 00:13:58	mattdesl	heh yep. i am also seeing a sharp increase in webgl related recruiting if that means anything
2015-02-13 00:14:03	stevenkane	nice
2015-02-13 00:14:10	stevenkane	I am job-averse in general lol
2015-02-13 00:14:13	mattdesl	and webgl people are in short demand in toronto.. so we are always looking
2015-02-13 00:14:16	stevenkane	but it is certainly a canaray
2015-02-13 00:14:23	stevenkane	nice nice
2015-02-13 00:14:24	stevenkane	ya
2015-02-13 00:14:30	stevenkane	I just find it all very satisfying
2015-02-13 00:14:35	stevenkane	daunting but satisfying
2015-02-13 00:14:52	stevenkane	I'm definetly one of those kids who was deeply impacted by Quake as a teen
2015-02-13 00:14:59	stevenkane	it left a pretty large impressino on me it would seem
2015-02-13 00:15:11	mattdesl	heh
2015-02-13 00:15:11	stevenkane	took awhile to get around to actually doing it myself tho (31 now)
2015-02-13 00:15:24	stevenkane	had a career as a bio-engineer initially etc
2015-02-13 00:15:34	stevenkane	at any rate, it's fun stuff

2015-02-14 17:08:18	QF-MichaelK	thibauts: you should thank them by making some tutorials ;)
2015-02-14 17:26:53	QF-MichaelK	thibauts: got any demo to share?  I'm still learning...
2015-02-14 17:41:19	thibauts	QF-MichaelK: I may write the docs I missed while learning when I get up to speed !
2015-02-14 17:41:47	thibauts	still discovering and getting familiar with the ecosystem

2015-02-14 18:10:46	@mikolalysenko	QF-MichaelK: do you know what the focus for your degree is going to be in?
2015-02-14 18:12:29	QF-MichaelK	mikolalysenko: No, haven't really dove into it yet, been too busy with classes and quals to do research.  Generally, somewhere in the computational neuroscience direction.  Possibly something to do with cerebellum, sleep, and education.
2015-02-14 18:39:32	QF-MichaelK	mikolalysenko: why, were you thinking it was graphics related?

2015-02-16 21:21:58	mattdesl	i think chrome is diffing the source or osmething. the response from setScriptSource gives me a ?change_tree? and ?textual_diff"
2015-02-16 21:30:14	JSON_voorheez	are there any projects to visualize an array buffer
2015-02-16 21:34:11	@mikolalysenko	JSON_voorheez: don't know of anything off the top of my head, but it would be cool to see one
2015-02-16 21:34:32	@mikolalysenko	as a suggestion, you could try having it log the array buffer contents to the console via console.table or the .image() trick
2015-02-16 21:34:51	@mikolalysenko	https://www.npmjs.com/package/ndarray-imshow does this
2015-02-16 21:34:55	@mikolalysenko	it is pretty handy I think
2015-02-16 21:35:14	mattdesl	JSON_voorheez sorta related - chrome WebGLInspector plugin lets you look at webgl buffers
2015-02-16 21:36:10	JSON_voorheez	mikolalysenko: interesting, i will need it to do some summarizing as the buffers i'm working wiht are quite large
2015-02-16 21:36:26	JSON_voorheez	(sometimes 10mb wav files)
2015-02-16 21:36:51	@mikolalysenko	would be neat to have like a spectrogram/waveform visualizer plugin
2015-02-16 21:36:57	JSON_voorheez	yeah
2015-02-16 21:37:02	@mikolalysenko	although an interactive mode would be nice too
2015-02-16 21:37:16	@mikolalysenko	I find that logging things to the shell works pretty well for debugging though
2015-02-16 21:37:24	@mikolalysenko	since you can scroll through the output and figure out what is going on
2015-02-16 21:37:31	JSON_voorheez	I have alittle module that will render an audiobuffer to canvas, but doesn't yet support zoom
2015-02-16 21:37:46	JSON_voorheez	maybe I can pull those out and make them work for any array buffer somehow
2015-02-16 21:37:55	@mikolalysenko	I wonder if there is a way to do svg in the console?
2015-02-16 21:38:07	@mikolalysenko	that could be made zoomable perhaps through css trickery
2015-02-16 21:38:41	JSON_voorheez	yeah shell is usally fine, but i wanna be able to do a bit more complex editing of the buffers and I feel like more visualizations would help me move quicker
2015-02-16 21:38:57	JSON_voorheez	it takes a while for me to get my head back into it just staring at the code
2015-02-16 21:40:03	JSON_voorheez	css zoom attribute seems to be fine for a certain level, but I would like zooming on these waveforms to match audacity's a bit better, which I think just means I need to re render each time
2015-02-16 21:40:56	JSON_voorheez	It takes time though, and it's in the main thread etc... been thinking of just rendering a couple and hiding/showing each while "zooming"
2015-02-16 21:41:07	JSON_voorheez	svg in console is interesting
2015-02-16 21:41:20	@mikolalysenko	yeah, a full featured in browser editor is also very useful

2015-02-17 18:08:30	mattdesl	nope sorry
2015-02-17 18:08:53	@mikolalysenko	know of any modules for css unit conversions?
2015-02-17 18:09:13	mattdesl	nah never needed it. dealing with devicePixelRatio?
2015-02-17 18:13:21	@mikolalysenko	dumber than that, trying to get scroll units working consistently across platforms
2015-02-17 18:13:43	@mikolalysenko	sometimes wheel gives you units in pixels (good)
2015-02-17 18:13:55	@mikolalysenko	sometimes wheel gives you units in line height (bad)
2015-02-17 18:14:08	@mikolalysenko	computing line height takes you down a psychedelic rabbit hole of css bullshit
2015-02-17 18:14:19	@mikolalysenko	or maybe there is a good trick here that I don't know
2015-02-17 18:21:28	mattdesl	hmm. probably not, the ThreeJS code i?ve seen for it just multiplies by hard coded differences depending on detected browser or something crappy

2015-02-17 21:19:15	TatumCreative	i'm actually building an immutable tree graph structure to use with webgl right now, that'll eventually drive a webgl application with
2015-02-17 21:19:18	TatumCreative	essentially i need undo
2015-02-17 21:19:48	TatumCreative	so i'm going to try to build the application in a real declarative fashion
2015-02-17 21:20:29	TatumCreative	not sure how it'll all turn out, but right now i have a mutable state object on it, that can freely change, but then won't end up serializing once you save your document to a database
2015-02-17 21:21:03	TatumCreative	so that way i can do a force directed layout (like with d3) without modifying the underlying data structure
2015-02-17 21:21:29	TatumCreative	react has definitely influenced my thinking on it
2015-02-17 21:21:49	TatumCreative	i'll end up memoizing the main data structure for the game loop, so i'll digest the tree and come up with the order that the update functions run
2015-02-17 21:22:15	TatumCreative	then when you trigger a tree change it'll recompute the order of the updates
2015-02-17 21:22:46	TatumCreative	the updates to the tree in my app don't happen realtime, but at most once every few seconds
2015-02-17 21:23:06	TatumCreative	so if there are a few frame drops it shouldn't be a problem, but i'm hoping there won't be any
2015-02-17 21:23:44	TatumCreative	each leaf on the tree can have a unique render / update function

2015-02-18 19:34:47	@mikolalysenko	gl-matrix does vertical by default, but some rift stuff uses horizontal
2015-02-18 19:34:59	@mikolalysenko	seems like vertical is a reasonable default

2015-02-18 20:31:38	mattdesl	ogd - you were asking about earth earlier ? https://www.npmjs.com/package/earth-triangulated
2015-02-18 20:32:08	ogd	EXCELLENT
2015-02-18 20:33:45	mattdesl	texturing might be a little trickier. there isn?t much for UVs or cube maps in stackgl ecosystem yet
2015-02-18 20:34:18	mattdesl	though on a sphere you can use unit normal in vert shader for uvs
2015-02-18 20:34:48	ogd	i wonder how i would draw a dot on top
2015-02-18 20:35:13	ogd	https://github.com/nodeschool/international-day/issues/10 :D
2015-02-18 21:20:40	mattdesl	ogd - you could use SDF alpha testing if you wanted the dot to be a symbol of some kind
2015-02-18 21:28:59	mattdesl	hughsk mikolalysenko - for modules that deal with colors, what do you guys prefer it to deal with? [ r, g, b ] in floats or bytes?
2015-02-18 21:29:35	mattdesl	seems like 0-255 is already kinda commonplace among npm
2015-02-18 21:29:59	@mikolalysenko	mattdesl: I like floats actually
2015-02-18 21:30:12	@mikolalysenko	0-1 gives the simplest rules for multiplicative blending
2015-02-18 21:30:29	@mikolalysenko	but the 255 is useful when interacting with uint8arrays that expect 0-255 storage
2015-02-18 21:30:37	mattdesl	and canvas / css
2015-02-18 21:30:45	@mikolalysenko	however the worst is what css does with rgba() where it uses 255 for rgb and 0-1 for a
2015-02-18 21:30:53	mattdesl	yeah brutal
2015-02-18 21:31:12	@mikolalysenko	here is my opinion:  prefer 0-1 everywhere
2015-02-18 21:31:21	@mikolalysenko	convert to 255 if you need to
2015-02-18 21:31:24	mattdesl	k.
2015-02-18 21:31:33	@hughsk	yeah I lean more towards floats because of WebGL, means you can handle hdr etc. too :)
2015-02-18 21:31:54	TatumCreative	+1 floats
2015-02-18 21:31:54	mattdesl	doing a little talk/lesson on modules at work on friday. trying to think of a simple module to make and actually publish so people can see the process
2015-02-18 21:32:31	@hughsk	nice!
2015-02-18 21:32:40	@hughsk	hmm
2015-02-18 21:33:58	@hughsk	perhaps converting 0xFFFFFF into [1, 1, 1]? Nice for setting clear colors with a hex value
2015-02-18 21:34:28	mattdesl	would be handy
2015-02-18 21:34:48	mattdesl	hex-to-rgb ?
2015-02-18 21:35:28	@hughsk	yeah that sounds good I think :)
2015-02-18 21:35:29	@mikolalysenko	that sound good to me, or maybe something to parse a css color
2015-02-18 21:36:02	@mikolalysenko	but it might take a bit too long to cover all the cases in a talk, haven't looked at all the different syntactic forms
2015-02-18 21:36:12	mattdesl	already a few of those on npm.. seems complex when you get into hsv/hsl/cmyk etc
2015-02-18 21:36:51	@mikolalysenko	oh and then there are also all the 'cute' colors, like 'red', 'green', 'blue' 'chartruese', etc
2015-02-18 21:37:59	@hughsk	ogd: sweet, let me know if you'd like any help getting the globe together :)
2015-02-18 21:38:09	mattdesl	ah https://www.npmjs.com/package/hex-to-rgb
2015-02-18 21:38:52	@mikolalysenko	mattdesl: actually, this could be a good exercise in composing modules
2015-02-18 21:38:58	@mikolalysenko	since there is stuff like this out there:  https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-color-names
2015-02-18 21:39:22	mattdesl	yeah it?s a quick chat though, only ~30 mins total :)
2015-02-18 21:41:19	TatumCreative	i've felt pretty frustrated when working with colors on getting it into the format i want
2015-02-18 21:44:22	@mikolalysenko	would like to have a simple, low over head solution for this
2015-02-18 21:44:57	@mikolalysenko	though reducing gc overhead is hard, since you need to allocate lots of string objects when working with css stuff
2015-02-18 21:45:32	@mikolalysenko	what you might be able to do is hardcode some common colors into a table and then just do a look up on those
2015-02-18 21:45:44	@mikolalysenko	and for the other cases you would then fall back to regexp munging
2015-02-18 21:46:06	@mikolalysenko	like all the common css names & some of the basic saturated/halftones
2015-02-18 21:46:13	@mikolalysenko	like '#000' and '#f00', etc
2015-02-18 21:47:09	mattdesl	heh.. our designers would never let us use #f00 in an actual production
2015-02-18 21:47:22	mattdesl	only really gets used in tests
2015-02-18 21:50:17	@mikolalysenko	man css color strings are super bloated
2015-02-18 21:51:18	@mikolalysenko	look at this mess:  http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#colorunits
2015-02-18 21:52:26	@mikolalysenko	so you got hashtag '#' which comes in either 12 bit or 24 bit
2015-02-18 21:52:48	@mikolalysenko	rgb and rgba, where the units can be 0-255 or 0-100%
2015-02-18 21:52:54	@mikolalysenko	hsl and hsla
2015-02-18 21:53:00	@mikolalysenko	and then all the fancy color names
2015-02-18 21:53:06	@hughsk	there's a whole layer of complexity that's coming in with the color() function too
2015-02-18 21:53:37	@mikolalysenko	oh good
2015-02-18 21:54:12	@hughsk	haha. probably needn't worry too much about gc pressure in this case though, most of the time you set initial colors when you're bootstrapping the app and then use something else for interpolation etc.
2015-02-18 21:54:28	@mikolalysenko	true
2015-02-18 21:54:41	@mikolalysenko	though one application that comes to mind is maybe building a webgl based canvas
2015-02-18 21:54:50	@mikolalysenko	which could be a fun project (though moderately insane)
2015-02-18 21:55:18	@mikolalysenko	it might be possible to beat vanilla canvas 2d for performance
2015-02-18 21:55:50	@mikolalysenko	but again the issue here would be why
2015-02-18 21:55:52	mattdesl	i think complex geom w/ anti-aliasing will be tough
2015-02-18 21:56:01	@mikolalysenko	maybe
2015-02-18 21:56:06	@mikolalysenko	but you could perhaps cut some corners
2015-02-18 21:56:22	@mikolalysenko	of course the better solution would be to just not use canvas at all and just do webgl directly
2015-02-18 21:56:23	mattdesl	line rendering is also kinda beastly https://www.npmjs.com/package/extrude-polyline
2015-02-18 21:57:33	@mikolalysenko	what about gl.lineWidth?
2015-02-18 21:57:58	@mikolalysenko	though I guess bevels would be a problem
2015-02-18 21:57:59	mattdesl	it is pretty shit. not consistent on a lot of drivers, doesn?t handle edge caps
2015-02-18 21:58:03	mattdesl	and joins
2015-02-18 21:58:20	mattdesl	unless it?s changed recently, ANGLE doesn?t support lineWidth at all.. just keeps it at 1.0
2015-02-18 21:58:48	@mikolalysenko	hmm
2015-02-18 22:00:14	tmpvar	even using skia, implementing CanvasRenderingContext2d was a PITA - https://github.com/tmpvar/context2d (still failing a couple tests)
2015-02-18 22:01:12	@mikolalysenko	whoa, that is awesome work
2015-02-18 22:01:44	tmpvar	hey, thanks :)
2015-02-18 22:03:51	tmpvar	the idea was to spawn a desktop window + context2d - https://github.com/tmpvar/node-boosh
2015-02-18 22:04:25	tmpvar	unfortunately, requestAnimationFrame across the c++ boundary causes ~20-50% cpu usage while idle
2015-02-18 22:05:21	tmpvar	sorry to derail the conversation! have you guys seen https://github.com/gameclosure/webgl-2d?
2015-02-18 22:06:51	@mikolalysenko	no, but it looks pretty cool
2015-02-18 22:07:30	@mikolalysenko	though I think that at some point the best solution for 2d is to just ditch the whole canvas api altogether, since it is not as efficient as webgl
2015-02-18 22:08:16	@mikolalysenko	maybe moving away from the whole fillStyle/path based notation and up to some higher level drawPolygon/drawPath routine
2015-02-18 22:08:49	@mikolalysenko	:(   https://github.com/gameclosure/webgl-2d/blob/master/webgl-2d.js#L948
2015-02-18 22:09:11	@mikolalysenko	seems like it still has a ways to go
2015-02-18 22:09:35	mattdesl	lol
2015-02-18 22:09:36	mattdesl	    // Need a solution for drawing text that isnt stupid slow
2015-02-18 22:10:32	mattdesl	^ also regarding abstractions. even just on our current project we have line / dot / circle rendering in 2D, but it sometimes also has to be projected in 3D
2015-02-18 22:11:03	mattdesl	so many ways of doing it though, and they all have different pros/cons
2015-02-18 22:11:17	mattdesl	like shader animations, or making the lines camera-facing so they have a constant thickness in 3D
2015-02-18 22:15:31	tmpvar	I'm all for a higher level api, maybe something like a (s)vg renderer?
2015-02-18 22:17:43	karen_punkpunk	Hi, has anyone seen this error before: cannot convert from '4-component vector of float' to 'mediump float' ?
2015-02-18 22:18:31	@mikolalysenko	karen_punkpunk:  you may have the types of your inputs wrong or it might be you forgot to specify precision
2015-02-18 22:18:46	@mikolalysenko	karen_punkpunk: if you post a gist it would be easier to debug
2015-02-18 22:19:01	@mikolalysenko	tmpvar: yeah, I think so, though maybe not as far as svg
2015-02-18 22:19:13	karen_punkpunk	oh wait a sec
2015-02-18 22:19:18	@mikolalysenko	something more like direct drawPolygon() etc
2015-02-18 22:19:49	@mikolalysenko	really you just need something that lets you quickly draw textured polygons, possibly with some matrix transformation
2015-02-18 22:19:59	@mikolalysenko	and that would be better than canvas 2d
2015-02-18 22:21:02	@mikolalysenko	the system could internally just concatenate all the vertices into a stream, and then call draw at the end of the frame
2015-02-18 22:23:27	tmpvar	are you saying upload verts every frame?

2015-02-23 15:42:15	@mikolalysenko	yeah, I agree; as an experiment it is interesting
2015-02-23 15:42:30	@mikolalysenko	I think the react approach makes a lot of sense when you have two different states you want to keep in sync
2015-02-23 15:42:40	@mikolalysenko	like a render state and a game/animation state
2015-02-23 15:42:53	@mikolalysenko	or you have app state and you have renderable state
2015-02-23 15:43:08	@mikolalysenko	but a more ideal solution is to just not have a separate renderable state
2015-02-23 15:43:23	@mikolalysenko	that is just use the app state to draw whatever you need to draw
2015-02-23 15:44:08	@mikolalysenko	I can see the react solution though working with three.js because three.js, like the dom, has a separate state that it uses to draw everything in the world which you need to synchronize with whatever is going on in your application

2015-03-02 16:42:09	mattdesl	hughsk mikolalysenko - maybe we should have a comparisons page for gl-geometry, gl-mesh, simplicial-complex, gl-simplicial-complex and related modules. noticing it causing some confusion among colleagues
2015-03-02 16:42:32	@mikolalysenko	yeah
2015-03-02 16:42:55	@mikolalysenko	I've been thinking lately about some other ways to approach this whole thing
2015-03-02 16:43:19	@mikolalysenko	like maybe trying a lower level/display list approach to rendering these things
2015-03-02 16:43:37	mattdesl	hm. no simplicial complex objects ?
2015-03-02 16:44:08	@mikolalysenko	they would still be there, but maybe things like gl-mesh/gl-geometry/gl-simplicial-complex could be deprecated
2015-03-02 16:44:29	@mikolalysenko	we would still use the same basic data structure though
2015-03-02 16:44:37	mattdesl	ok cool.
2015-03-02 16:44:48	@mikolalysenko	(disclaimer: this is speculative right now)
2015-03-02 16:44:59	@mikolalysenko	but the way I sort of see this working is that you would just have "draw commands"
2015-03-02 16:45:16	@mikolalysenko	where each draw command is a complete shader + uniform + attribute + buffer state binding
2015-03-02 16:45:37	@mikolalysenko	and then you would have a separate command list module that just organizes these commands and runs them
2015-03-02 16:45:54	@mikolalysenko	and optionally does stuff like set default uniform values or set up fbo binding data
2015-03-02 16:46:19	@mikolalysenko	kind of like retro gl1.0 display lists, but updated to handle shaders and so on
2015-03-02 16:47:00	@mikolalysenko	basically I see this as what gl-geometry/gl-mesh want to do:  which is they want to provide an api for encapsulating a draw call state
2015-03-02 16:47:18	@mikolalysenko	so you can just serialize that thing and then play it back whenever
2015-03-02 16:47:45	@mikolalysenko	I still need to think more about how partial binding of uniforms would work, but this seems promising
2015-03-02 16:47:58	@mikolalysenko	since you could also do stuff like build multiple command lists in parallel
2015-03-02 16:48:24	@mikolalysenko	and the command list could also handle things like ordering draw calls in some optimized way, or taking into account transparency
2015-03-02 16:50:09	@mikolalysenko	anyway, as a synposis of where it is now:  gl-mesh is deprecated,  gl-geometry is something like a higher level gl-vao, and gl-simplicial-complex is a widget which I've been developing mainly for plotly
2015-03-02 16:50:22	@mikolalysenko	which handles drawing meshes with materials/lighting/etc. and lots of other features
2015-03-02 16:51:37	@mikolalysenko	long term, what I want to do is build something like a display list data structure which I think will give a good solution to this problem and other issues
2015-03-02 16:52:28	@mikolalysenko	the idea is that you have commands which are just defined once when you create some object, and then you can build dynamic lists of commands at run time when you draw a frame
2015-03-02 16:52:49	mattdesl	yeah this sounds good. i think main thing is to KISS as we continue. the simplicial-complex readme is a big daunting to newbies, heh
2015-03-02 16:53:15	@mikolalysenko	yeah, simplicial-complex could stand to be refactored into tinier modules
2015-03-02 16:53:35	@mikolalysenko	it was one of the earlier things I wrote, so I would probably do it differently today
2015-03-02 16:53:55	@mikolalysenko	and gl-simplicial-complex is a mess because it is mainly for a client and their needs, and so it kind of evolved as specs/features changed

2015-03-03 00:01:13	pyrotechnick	the extra ~100 faces between the 4th and 6th levels really make a difference
2015-03-03 00:09:27	@mikolalysenko	awesome!
2015-03-03 00:09:40	@mikolalysenko	you should next write a shader to display them interactively

2015-03-03 00:31:58	@mikolalysenko	it is not as hard as you would think
2015-03-03 00:32:11	@mikolalysenko	it just requires sorting the vertices in pop buffer order and then rounding them in a vertex shader
2015-03-03 00:32:29	@mikolalysenko	you could just write a snippet of a vertex shader which does the rounding bit, and put that on npm via glslify
2015-03-03 00:33:08	@mikolalysenko	and then the user would just stream in vertex data to a buffer and draw the first few levels worth of vertices with appropriate rounding applies

2015-03-03 15:40:00	MikkoH_	I was working on some modules to create geometry for futuristic uis (movie style uis) awhile back. I was rendering via gl-mesh. Want to make them more inline with whats going on with stack-gl now.

2015-03-03 16:05:23	_MikkoH_	Since then I?ve added a few other geometries. There?s like a flat chevron. Like a pancake shape that can have a hole.
2015-03-03 16:05:43	_MikkoH_	But yeah the idea is to make a module with just a bunch of geometries that are nice for futuristic uis ;)
2015-03-03 16:06:28	yoshuawuyts	_MikkoH_: I'm really digging this.
2015-03-03 16:06:41	yoshuawuyts	_MikkoH_: is it on GH by any chance?
2015-03-03 16:07:45	TatumCreative	_MikkoH_: that's pretty!
2015-03-03 16:13:11	_MikkoH_	yoshuawuyts it?s not on GH yet. Like I said this was something I was just messing with after work one day to relax. Actually was working on the most intense project I had ever worked and needed a break.
2015-03-03 16:13:42	_MikkoH_	I wanna put it on GH but I want to ensure it?s ideologically sound with this notion of simplicial-complex ruling everything in Stack.GL
2015-03-03 16:14:46	TatumCreative	_MikkoH_ i usually just throw my half-baked ideas out there :D
2015-03-03 16:15:15	_MikkoH_	So do I. I guess I just felt more reserved considering a lot of stuff in Stack.gl was changing in August.
2015-03-03 16:16:00	_MikkoH_	The reason I?m asking is because I noticed that mesh-combine assumes that cells always has 3 values [[0, 1, 2]]
2015-03-03 16:16:30	_MikkoH_	I?m in the process making a pull request which will work on n components for mesh-combine. But not sure if it?s ?right?

2015-03-03 16:29:48	TatumCreative	i need to get my agency to sell some webgl :)
2015-03-03 16:29:58	TatumCreative	by my, i mean, the agency i work for
2015-03-03 16:30:15	mattdesl	yeah lots of webgl here :)
2015-03-03 16:30:26	TatumCreative	we're doing the site for a gaming conference, i'm going to try to sneak in a mini-game
2015-03-03 16:30:38	TatumCreative	we do a lot of tourism stuff, seems like i could fit it in somehow
2015-03-03 16:30:56	mattdesl	when in doubt, add particles !
2015-03-03 16:31:12	TatumCreative	ooo!
2015-03-03 16:31:18	TatumCreative	i actually like that philosophy
2015-03-03 16:31:24	TatumCreative	cheap and easy wow factor
2015-03-03 16:31:38	mattdesl	or include some 3D earth stuff  http://hughsk.io/earth-triangulated/
2015-03-03 16:32:24	yoshuawuyts	mattdesl: keep showering us with your words, o enlightened one
2015-03-03 16:32:43	TatumCreative	i should just throw some cheeseball effects in to some projects so we can start selling it
2015-03-03 16:32:57	mattdesl	lol. i think particles was our main driving factor for early webgl work
2015-03-03 16:33:19	mattdesl	but now with iOS8 some clients are more on board with webgl everything
2015-03-03 16:33:28	_MikkoH_	TatumCreative: some times too much WebGL at Jam3 ;) Hard sometimes when clients don?t understand
2015-03-03 16:34:01	_MikkoH_	mattdesl: add particles ;) HAHA this morning I was thinking of creating a ruled based module particle system. ;)
2015-03-03 16:34:14	TatumCreative	yeah, i pitched an oil and gas company some webgl stuff, it didn't go anywhere, they were like "wtf?"
2015-03-03 16:34:31	TatumCreative	rather, i pitched an account exec who pitched them
2015-03-03 16:34:53	TatumCreative	of course they are all probably running ie8
2015-03-03 16:35:11	_MikkoH_	oil and gas companies are the worst to work with? we had a project get cancelled that was fully done and people had worked late nights on because they found out? gasp? we had used open source code in the project
2015-03-03 16:35:27	TatumCreative	:D
2015-03-03 16:35:29	TatumCreative	that's awesome
2015-03-03 16:35:32	_MikkoH_	this was back when we did a lot of flash
2015-03-03 16:35:53	TatumCreative	:.( flash
2015-03-03 16:36:03	TatumCreative	I did some fun stuff using flash
2015-03-03 16:36:13	TatumCreative	i worked at an aquarium for 5 years, and built some fun interactive kiosks
2015-03-03 16:36:15	_MikkoH_	we?ve learned since how to protect ourselves from situations like that. but it also means we need to give our clients a list of open source libraries we use. which is difficult now when we don?t use monolithic libraries
2015-03-03 16:36:21	TatumCreative	probably my most viewed work
2015-03-03 16:36:30	_MikkoH_	Flash still has it?s place
2015-03-03 16:36:51	TatumCreative	our RFPs include the fact that we use open source
2015-03-03 16:37:06	_MikkoH_	For Orange I actually had to do a lot of As3. I was the garbage man on that project. mattdesl was the shining star with Tom (aka bunnybones1)
2015-03-03 16:37:07	TatumCreative	somehow we made that transition in the past 2 years
2015-03-03 16:37:38	TatumCreative	I had to do a flash ad a couple months back, and I'm amazed how much I've forgotten of AS3
2015-03-03 16:37:40	_MikkoH_	our contracts state we?ll be creating open source libraries on their projects. :) or at least the work we do for google.
2015-03-03 16:39:43	TatumCreative	Yeah, I think i'm just going to have to spend some of my own time creating some thing flashy for a project to get the ball rolling. We're pretty small on the dev team side.
2015-03-03 16:39:55	yoshuawuyts	_MikkoH_: how is that laid out? Will most of the code become open source? Does jam3 also invest company-paid time in the libraries?
2015-03-03 16:40:00	_MikkoH_	Anyway. Does anyone have an answer to my original question? Is it safe to assume that modules that export simplicial-complices should be in the form {positions:[[]],cells[[]]} And an the inner array of cells may be any length?
2015-03-03 16:41:36	mattdesl	yeah, i think triangles is typical but a simplicial complex could be just edges or points too
2015-03-03 16:45:14	_MikkoH_	yoshuawuyts: I?m not sure of the nitty gritty details of how it was laid out. Thats the nice thing when the company becomes 15+ people there are others to do that kinda stuff. Anything we deem to be a module becomes open source. Jam3 currently doesn?t invest in company-paid time in libraries. Although I have gotten breaks from projects to work on stuff in the past. But this was awhile back. It?s something I?m trying to work towards. I?ve been tr
2015-03-03 16:45:14	_MikkoH_	to work on a module called f1 which I hope would begin to save time from creating UI. (our biggest time sync) But the thought is if we can save time on our projects we?ll have more time to create modules/open source stuff.
2015-03-03 16:46:59	yoshuawuyts	_MikkoH_: oh, that's very neat! Thanks for clarifying ^_____^
2015-03-03 16:47:17	_MikkoH_	Yeah most of the modules we?re creating are on project.
2015-03-03 16:47:28	_MikkoH_	Which is what I?d imagine most companies do

2015-03-03 19:55:20	@mikolalysenko	simplicial complex is jargon from algebraic topology, but I think it is the right sort of dimension independent way to talk about triangulated meshes
2015-03-03 19:55:41	@mikolalysenko	as it applies in higher dimensions too

2015-03-03 20:05:50	_MikkoH_	ok cool. So I?m doing things right mikolalysenko:
2015-03-03 20:06:05	_MikkoH_	thanks
2015-03-03 20:06:05	@mikolalysenko	yeah
2015-03-03 20:06:15	@mikolalysenko	or I don't actually think there is a way to do it wrong
2015-03-03 20:06:27	_MikkoH_	just overall got confused because of combine-mesh being hardcoded
2015-03-03 20:06:33	_MikkoH_	;) even better
2015-03-03 20:07:03	@mikolalysenko	there can be multiple solutions I think
2015-03-03 20:07:20	@mikolalysenko	right now the stackgl is in the stage where it is growing and accumulating mutations
2015-03-03 20:08:00	@mikolalysenko	there will also be times to reflect and condense the most successful ideas too
2015-03-03 20:08:25	@mikolalysenko	and then to take those successful ideas and mutate them further
2015-03-03 20:08:39	@mikolalysenko	in an eternal cycle of evolutionary devlopment
2015-03-03 20:08:46	_MikkoH_	open source ;)
2015-03-03 20:09:33	_MikkoH_	its nice to see everyone joining at least on a ?standard? way of doing things. In August a lot was happening and it was harder to just jump in and contribute
2015-03-03 20:10:31	@mikolalysenko	yeah, I am thinking about eventually spinning out some notes from a class I taught last semester into some formal documentation
2015-03-03 20:10:43	@mikolalysenko	talking about simplicial complexes and data structures for geometry/graphics processing
2015-03-03 20:11:04	@mikolalysenko	lots of stuff to do though

2015-03-06 01:54:27	@hughsk	glslify@2 is DONE. I just need to write up tests and a browserify transform and then it's good to go
2015-03-06 01:54:34	mattdesl	holy wow
2015-03-06 01:54:45	mattdesl	works in node? or is that another milestone later on?
2015-03-06 01:55:15	@hughsk	works in node, just needs to be async :)
2015-03-06 01:55:21	@hughsk	but for pex, it shouldn't be a problem
2015-03-06 01:56:07	@hughsk	can use whatever abstraction marc's using there, but noop the draw operations until the shader's built
2015-03-06 01:56:24	@hughsk	which is never more than ~20ms
2015-03-06 01:57:50	mattdesl	nice work
2015-03-06 01:58:27	@hughsk	thanks! big relief to have pushed through that and got it done
2015-03-06 01:58:56	substack	^5
2015-03-06 01:59:19	@hughsk	might be another week or so before it's out but will definitely be before mikolalysenko leaves town :)
2015-03-06 02:00:20	@mikolalysenko	big success!

2015-03-07 00:27:57	@mikolalysenko	thibauts: cool!
2015-03-07 00:28:05	QF-MichaelK	thibauts: Wow, great job!  Very cool demo.  I'd like to be able to control the different levels with a key press or some slider.  It's a little too quick for my eyes.
2015-03-07 00:28:22	@mikolalysenko	also you could do the pop in the shader
2015-03-07 00:28:32	@mikolalysenko	err I mean the rounding to lower levels
2015-03-07 00:28:41	@mikolalysenko	ideally the mesh should be stored in one contiguous array on the gpu
2015-03-07 00:28:54	@mikolalysenko	so different levels correspond to draw calls with different offsets
2015-03-07 00:29:03	@mikolalysenko	but this looks great!
2015-03-07 00:29:58	mattdesl	is it for LOD?
2015-03-07 00:31:18	QF-MichaelK	mattdesl: I think it's for smoothing point cloud data into a mesh, but I could be wrong...
2015-03-07 00:31:54	thibauts	this is for LOD yes
2015-03-07 00:32:05	thibauts	progressive loading without updating buffers
2015-03-07 00:32:30	thibauts	in essence this is an append-only buffer on the GPU that gives you progressive detail as the mesh chunks arrive
2015-03-07 00:32:43	mattdesl	ah.. like JPEG
2015-03-07 00:32:48	@hughsk	exactly :)
2015-03-07 00:32:53	thibauts	ffor now the decoding is done in JS
2015-03-07 00:32:56	mattdesl	that?s pretty badass
2015-03-07 00:33:07	thibauts	but as mikolalysenko suggested it could be done quite easily in a shader
2015-03-07 00:33:08	@hughsk	yeah thibauts, that's awesome :D
2015-03-07 00:34:28	thibauts	now i hope there really is no patent
2015-03-07 00:34:55	@mikolalysenko	I don't think there is anything
2015-03-07 00:34:59	@mikolalysenko	http://x3dom.org/pop/
2015-03-07 00:35:05	@mikolalysenko	you think they would post it on the website
2015-03-07 00:35:10	@mikolalysenko	maybe good to send them an email
2015-03-07 00:35:32	mattdesl	i wonder how it looks in practice. our designers don?t enjoy stuff like progressive loading because there is a slight blip where the mesh/image/etc looks shitty
2015-03-07 00:35:36	thibauts	yes i'll do that
2015-03-07 00:35:42	chrisdickinson	hughsk: super way belatedly re callbacks (https://github.com/stackgl/glslify/issues/23), thus far I've used the value injection for that purpose
2015-03-07 00:36:22	thibauts	mattdesl: in practice you can refine the mesh depending on what artifacts will be seen or not
2015-03-07 00:36:28	chrisdickinson	in the example linked in that issue, you could do something like `#pragma glslify: x = require(./file1.glsl, getColor=getColor)`
2015-03-07 00:36:39	thibauts	like, compute the acceptable error given the mesh distance
2015-03-07 00:36:56	mattdesl	anything like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6XIdJ0IA1Y
2015-03-07 00:37:03	mattdesl	or is that totally different
2015-03-07 00:37:59	@hughsk	chrisdickinson: yeah, that approach works well! long-term might be nicer having them inline but think for now it's the way to go
2015-03-07 00:38:07	thibauts	this is kindof the same idea but pop buffers have different characteristics, they encode and decode much faster
2015-03-07 00:38:54	thibauts	mattdesl: with edge collapse you can't have an append-only buffer on the GPU as you have to update vertex coordinates

2015-03-07 00:40:04	thibauts	mattdesl: for me this scheme is mostly useful because i when to use it in a mapping app a la google earth, with 3D buildings
2015-03-07 00:40:12	thibauts	s/when/want/
2015-03-07 00:41:02	thibauts	mikolalysenko: i did my best to be implement what the paper describes but any input is welcome. and PR too of course :p
2015-03-07 00:41:22	@mikolalysenko	thibauts: cool!  I'll take a look later and maybe try something
2015-03-07 00:41:37	@mikolalysenko	mattdesl: it is also useful for rendering distant objects
2015-03-07 00:42:23	@mikolalysenko	since the geometry can be squeezed into a single buffer, you don't need to store multiple lods separately
2015-03-07 00:42:38	@mikolalysenko	ie you can reuse the same geometry for multiple versions of the file
2015-03-07 00:44:56	QF-MichaelK	maybe store the offsets in some dope vector?
2015-03-07 00:47:15	QF-MichaelK	sorry, just really wanted to use that silly term from Scott's book...

2015-03-07 22:12:09	mattdesl	arggh so close to screen space projected lines.. but it?s pinching at the miter join :( http://imgur.com/PeizxFU
2015-03-07 22:17:10	QF-MichaelK	the pinch is expected unless you set a constraint to make that corner change.
2015-03-07 22:17:18	QF-MichaelK	(bottom right)
2015-03-07 22:18:18	QF-MichaelK	you could add a point just above the bottom right (in line with the middle horizontal) to have it skew more favorably

You could constrain it to cubics for ease.  Can you get the derivative via decasteljau?  The last level is the point, so the second to last holds the tangent, from there, you just need the acceleration direction... perhaps the dot product o

2015-03-09 15:02:10	MikkoH_	I think it?s not a huge change/performance hit but it?s a large useability improvement. I really like the flexibility of three parameters but sometimes the lazy programmer in me just grovels at having to type the same thing twice.

2015-03-10 12:24:24	thibauts	is there something already existing to extract the connected components from the boundaries ?
2015-03-10 12:25:37	thibauts	i'll need to detect holes in meshes and return the holes with the edges or vertices ordered
