2015-03-07 20:16:09	nkar	I don't want to have a separate file, it's a one line change

2015-03-07 22:59:52	viric	there are multiple options, which of course I forgot
2015-03-07 22:59:54	azriphale	I was playing with twmnd as a notificaion system. I haven't had that going since I switched to nixos. But I could easily plug into that
2015-03-07 22:59:55	benley	yeah after that happened a few times I got around to writing a battery meter widget in lua
2015-03-07 23:00:09	viric	the meter is easy
2015-03-07 23:00:17	azriphale	(only been on nixos as my main system since the beginning of the week)
2015-03-07 23:00:29	benley	the alerts I still don't have, but at least having a visible "BATTERY TURNING RED" thing helps
2015-03-07 23:00:30	viric	the important part is noticing the low battery

2015-03-07 23:14:10	azriphale	Am I correct in thinking that the command nix-env --delete-generations old will delete _all_ generations that are not the current generation?

2015-03-07 23:14:35	benley	azriphale: I think so yes
2015-03-07 23:14:36	kmicu	GuixSD should be more fun.
2015-03-07 23:14:51	azriphale	Actually, I found the nix expression language much more readable than guile in this domain (and I am not a newcomer to lisp like I was to nix)
2015-03-07 23:15:00	benley	what's GuixSD?

2015-03-08 00:40:49	benley	my branch is mostly tracking nixpkgs unstable with whatever cherrypicks I need applied
2015-03-08 00:40:49	blueyed	benley: sounds good then.. :)
2015-03-08 00:41:25	blueyed	benley: you mean you track "master" of nixpkgs?
2015-03-08 00:42:01	benley	nope, actually following the commit where the unstable channel is.
2015-03-08 00:42:26	benley	https://github.com/benley/nixpkgs/tree/folsomlabs
2015-03-08 00:42:43	blueyed	ok, then it's outdated - any your hydra does not much additionally, just for your changes then?!
2015-03-08 00:43:12	benley	exactly, it builds the packages I actually rely on
2015-03-08 00:43:59	benley	along with the nixpkgs fork I have a private repo for internal stuff, and that's what my hydra jobs build
2015-03-08 00:44:22	blueyed	But with Hydra in place, you could also track master?  But then it's probably better to use what passes the unstable test then.
2015-03-08 00:44:51	ewemoa	schoppenhauer: i guess the following section doesn't help, huh? http://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ch-installing-binary
2015-03-08 00:45:18	benley	blueyed: exactly - I figure tracking unstable means things will break less for me

2015-03-08 01:23:52	FrozenCow_	i've found another package that had the same issue, but has a workaround
2015-03-08 01:24:45	FrozenCow_	azriphale,  https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/bb298fb0bf1e6aad21141d01a329d861ac1873eb/pkgs/applications/audio/gpodder/default.nix#L56
2015-03-08 01:26:21	FrozenCow_	here it adds the 'import sys; sys.argv[0] = "executablename"': https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/python-modules/generic/wrap.sh#L33
2015-03-08 01:27:07	FrozenCow_	it does also look whether 'import __future__' is there too, but I guess that detection didn't work correctly for gpodder (and git-cola in my case)
2015-03-08 01:27:19	azriphale	I haven't tried to package any Python packages with nix yet, so I'm just grepping nixpkgs.
2015-03-08 01:27:31	FrozenCow_	ah, same here ;)
2015-03-08 01:28:01	azriphale	That sed is also above my level.
2015-03-08 01:28:47	FrozenCow_	yes, it seems to check whether there are comments in-between them as wel... however, for git-cola's case it looks like:
2015-03-08 01:28:59	azriphale	Would be useful to run it over a couple of python files (the __future__ import on the very first line, the __future__ import after a module docstring etc)

2015-03-08 08:38:21	ktosiek	nix-env is less declarative - there's a file that's used as a basis for creating a new profile from the current one + changes you asked for
2015-03-08 08:39:06	ktosiek	but I think you can create declarative "packs" of packages that nix-env will install/update together, I'll see if I can find it in a minute

2015-03-08 08:49:03	joelmo	yes, but if two derivations provide bin/foo, they can't exist in same user environment so nix will ask you to choose one

2015-03-08 21:31:19	azriphale	You probably want to read through the configuration section of the manual: https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/
2015-03-08 21:31:25	azriphale	basically, you edit configuration.nix
2015-03-08 21:31:40	bubblegun	tks man
2015-03-08 21:31:44	azriphale	then (as root) run "nixos-rebuild test" to enable the config in the current session

2015-03-08 21:31:47	bubblegun	for now
2015-03-08 21:32:00	azriphale	If that works as expected, you cab nixos-rebuild switch to enable it on boot

2015-03-08 21:32:13	bubblegun	:P

2015-03-09 00:50:20	codehero	why do so many builds fail?
2015-03-09 00:50:40	codehero	is there not a way to only add packages if they build and leave the other ones alone?
2015-03-09 00:50:50	codehero	or is it more complicated than that?
2015-03-09 00:51:13	the-kenny	codehero: the issue is deeper: It's likely some pretty basic thing of the system that fails somehow & all the builds depend on it somehow
2015-03-09 00:51:23	codehero	ah, okay
2015-03-09 00:51:34	the-kenny	if even gnu hello fails something more basic is broken :D
2015-03-09 00:51:44	codehero	lol
2015-03-09 00:51:59	codehero	is there an easy way to find out what is causing this?
2015-03-09 00:52:40	the-kenny	check logs on broken packages & track down. Shouldn't be too ahrd
2015-03-09 00:53:17	the-kenny	seems like ld can't find libgcc or something like that
2015-03-09 00:53:59	the-kenny	codehero: you can click on a failing build, like http://hydra.nixos.org/build/19370371 and then click on the 'changes' link & see what git commits happened between the last working and this build
2015-03-09 00:54:17	codehero	oh. okay
2015-03-09 00:55:18	codehero	i feel like it should be easier
2015-03-09 00:55:42	codehero	but maybe that's not even possible
2015-03-09 00:56:09	the-kenny	NixOS is a complex linux distribution. And Hydra is underpowered
2015-03-09 00:57:44	codehero	well, i thinking about preventing utter failure builds. but i'm not sure how that could be accomplished
2015-03-09 00:58:48	codehero	that's why the channel doesn't update when something doesn't build, yeah. but if there was just a way to build one thing and test how it affects the rest
2015-03-09 00:58:52	codehero	or something like that
2015-03-09 00:59:01	Haskellfant	nox can do that afaik
2015-03-09 00:59:06	Haskellfant	nox review or something like that
2015-03-09 00:59:21	Haskellfant	but nobody has the time to wait for everything to rebuild if you update glibc or something like that
2015-03-09 00:59:35	codehero	hmm. true
2015-03-09 00:59:46	Fuuzetsu	 that's why those huge updates go into staging to sit for a while
2015-03-09 01:00:16	codehero	even in unstable?
2015-03-09 01:00:47	Haskellfant	yep
2015-03-09 01:00:51	codehero	huh
2015-03-09 01:01:01	codehero	okay. well then
2015-03-09 01:01:02	Haskellfant	at least theoretically everything causing a mass rebuild goes to staging afaik
2015-03-09 01:01:29	codehero	so security updates would go right through, even if everything else fails?
2015-03-09 01:04:50	dav	it would be good if we could ask for which jobs started failing between 2 builds
2015-03-09 01:05:12	dav	because right now both newly failing and still failing jobs doesn't tell much

2015-03-09 01:49:55	wkennington	dav: nothing is really failing
2015-03-09 01:50:04	wkennington	dav: the evaluator is fallling over due to poor gc config
2015-03-09 01:50:17	wkennington	dav: which is really a nix problem moreso than nixpkgs
2015-03-09 01:50:36	wkennington	i think this has to do with the changes which drasticly increase the size of evaluation
2015-03-09 01:50:41	wkennington	namely nodejs
2015-03-09 01:50:41	copumpkin	it's a feature not a bug!
2015-03-09 01:50:42	 *	copumpkin runs
2015-03-09 01:50:55	wkennington	im really sick of all the gc / sqlite issue
2015-03-09 01:50:57	wkennington	issues*
2015-03-09 01:51:06	copumpkin	are the two related?
2015-03-09 01:51:09	wkennington	nope
2015-03-09 01:51:09	copumpkin	or you're just sick of both?
2015-03-09 01:51:12	copumpkin	ah okay
2015-03-09 01:51:28	wkennington	granted, i don't really have a solution
2015-03-09 01:52:13	wkennington	requiring the allocation of 2GB ram for a single nixpkgs evaluation is kinda problematic though
2015-03-09 01:52:20	wkennington	i believe that's where we are at now
2015-03-09 01:52:39	wkennington	i mean, sure machines can be beefed up
2015-03-09 01:52:51	wkennington	but we need a better way to scale out
2015-03-09 01:54:42	wkennington	Too many heap sections: Increase MAXHINCR or MAX_HEAP_SECTS
2015-03-09 01:54:47	wkennington	so yeah
2015-03-09 01:54:48	Fuuzetsu	ugh? can't cabal2nix the cabal2nix project itself because it does something weird now and doesn't have a static cabal file?

2015-03-09 11:57:09	viric	(result of a merge)
2015-03-09 11:57:33	viric	I need to unstage all to keep all in a stash.
2015-03-09 11:57:55	fnord__	rzetterberg: I would appreciate that, too. I've started with the nix-wiki page on Haskell and the blog posted linked there for using per-project settings. But the wiki page seems to be work in progress and the blog articles seem to be mostly pre-haskellng. For haskellng there is a small introduction in from the mailinglist: http://lists.science.uu.nl/pipermail/nix-dev/2015-January/015591.html
2015-03-09 11:59:03	fnord__	rzetterberg: I could tell you my current setup, which is some sort patchwork of +10 different articles, and I'm not sure it is the idiomatic way and I can explain everything correctly
2015-03-09 12:00:28	rzetterberg	fnord_: Thanks! Have not seen that introduction in the mail list.

2015-03-09 12:01:36	Haskellfant	rzetterberg: haskellng is basically what most people seem to be using now (and should because the old one will get dropped in a few weeks afaik). ghcWithPackages is needed for stuff that you want for development, so globally installed libraries, ghc-mod and so on should go in there. as I tend to not install any libraries globally I just have my development tools in there. standalone haskell binaries that don't
2015-03-09 12:01:38	Haskellfant	compile anything (e.g. cabal2nix) can just be installed directly
2015-03-09 12:01:58	Haskellfant	note: this is my understanding of things which is not necessarily correct

2015-03-09 12:06:28	fnord__	rzetterberg: oh, and a heads-up if you are planning on using ghc-mod with ghc <= 7.8.* and cabal-install >= 1.22.* (the default one): it doesn't work. I had to downgrade cabal-install to 1.20.* for the combination to work
2015-03-09 12:06:49	rzetterberg	fnord_: Alright, thanks for the heads up!

2015-03-09 12:10:19	rzetterberg	So if I understand it correctly, you should use ghcWithPackages which installs a custom ghc with only the packages you specify?
2015-03-09 12:10:33	fnord__	Haskellfant: since you are also using cabal2nix from haskellng: does upgrading with nix-env also downgrades the cabal2nix-2.0 to the haskellPackages version 1.73? It is also displayed as "too new" with nix-env -qc
2015-03-09 12:10:47	Haskellfant	yeah ignore that
2015-03-09 12:10:57	Haskellfant	as in: don't do that ?update?
2015-03-09 12:11:20	fnord__	ok, glad it is not my setup ;)
2015-03-09 12:11:34	fnord__	has this something to do with haskellng not being official yet?
2015-03-09 12:11:39	Haskellfant	I think so
2015-03-09 12:11:46	Haskellfant	or it is related to nix-env being stupid
2015-03-09 12:11:53	fnord__	;3
2015-03-09 12:12:11	Haskellfant	an upgrade that wants to downgrade to a lower version is imho broken
2015-03-09 12:12:15	Fuuzetsu	use haskellngPackages.cabal2nix
2015-03-09 12:12:22	Haskellfant	even if the other package is not official
2015-03-09 12:13:02	fnord__	Fuuzetsu: I did, I've installed with  nix-env -i -A nixos.pkgs.haskellngPackages.cabal2nix
2015-03-09 12:13:27	Fuuzetsu	what is it trying to downgrade to?
2015-03-09 12:13:41	Haskellfant	nix-env -u is trying to downgrad cabal2nix-2.0 to cabal2nix-1.73
2015-03-09 12:13:49	fnord__	version 1.73, I think that is the one from haskellPackages
2015-03-09 12:14:06	Haskellfant	also it's trying to downgrade ghc-7.10.? to ghc-7.8.4-wrapper
2015-03-09 12:14:19	fnord__	yep, it's the one from haskellPackages
2015-03-09 12:14:44	Fuuzetsu	are you making sure to pass recent git checkout when running -u
2015-03-09 12:14:49	Haskellfant	yes
2015-03-09 12:14:54	fnord__	and upgrade openjdk7 to openjdk8 even if I explicitly installed the 7 package
2015-03-09 12:15:15	fnord__	and I'm using the unstable channel
2015-03-09 12:15:18	Haskellfant	that's at least an upgrade
2015-03-09 12:15:23	fnord__	as in nixpkgs unstable
2015-03-09 12:16:20	Haskellfant	fnord__: that last one looks correct, the 8 is just in the version number so obviously nix-env thinks it?s an update
2015-03-09 12:16:35	Haskellfant	(ofc one could argue that they should be separate
2015-03-09 12:16:37	Haskellfant	)
2015-03-09 12:16:50	Haskellfant	not quite sure how backwards compatible openjdk is
2015-03-09 12:17:07	Haskellfant	but most other distros seem to have separate packages so that probably makes sense
2015-03-09 12:17:20	fnord__	Haskellfant: yeah but it is unexpected in the sense that there are two packages: openjdk with version 7, and openjdk8 with version 8
2015-03-09 12:17:27	fnord__	at least unexpected for me ;)
2015-03-09 12:17:43	Haskellfant	yeah if we have separate packages they shouldn't upgrade
2015-03-09 12:18:11	Haskellfant	changing the name to openjdk8-? should probably fix that
2015-03-09 12:18:28	Haskellfant	fnord__: could you open an issue for that and ping me (@cocreature)? I'll take a look in the next days
2015-03-09 12:18:44	fnord__	I just hat the same suspicion :)
2015-03-09 12:19:01	fnord__	Haskellfant: ok I'll do that
2015-03-09 12:19:02	Haskellfant	(ofc if you wan't to fix it yourself even better)

2015-03-09 12:39:13	fnord__	rzetterberg: Instead of using ghcWithPackages, I use the wrapped version of ghc, which will automatically detect libraries installed afterwards.
2015-03-09 12:39:13	fnord__	I install my development environment tools on a per-user basis, which are cabal2nix from haskellngPackages and ghcMod, pointfree, hdevtools, hasktags, cabalInstall_1_20_0_6 from regular haskellPackages (haskellng does not have a downgraded cabalInstall).
2015-03-09 12:39:13	fnord__	In my haskell projects I use cabal2nix to convert my cabal file to nix-expressions for installing and nix-shell (the haskellng version is required to generate expressions for nix-shell), by running
2015-03-09 12:39:13	fnord__	  cabal2nix ./. > default.nix
2015-03-09 12:39:13	fnord__	  cabal2nix --shell ./. > shell.nix
2015-03-09 12:39:13	fnord__	in my project directory.
2015-03-09 12:39:14	fnord__	Then i run "nix-shell shell.nix" which drops me into a shell where I have access to both the per-user stuff and the project-dependencies from the cabal file, and I can simply run cabal configure, cabal repl etc. Because of the wrapped ghc the per-project libraries are found by ghc and everything worked fine so far.
2015-03-09 12:40:57	fnord__	So far everything worked fine, but I'm not sure if this will cause problems in the future. I'm especially concerned about mixing haskellngPackages and haskellPackages.

2015-03-09 14:09:06	warbo	@Fuuzetsu doesn't work
2015-03-09 14:09:35	Fuuzetsu	are you running in a pure shell?
2015-03-09 14:09:50	Fuuzetsu	can you post your cabal file and default.nix as well as all commands you're trying
2015-03-09 14:09:57	warbo	@Fuuzetsu I can get into a Nix shell, but "cabal configure", "cabal repl", "ghci -package ghc", etc. all complain that "Could not find module ?GHC?
2015-03-09 14:09:57	warbo	    It is a member of the hidden package ?ghc-7.8.4?."

2015-03-09 14:11:12	warbo	@Haskellfant I have an "executable" section and a "test-suite" section, which both have "ghc" in their "build-depends"
2015-03-09 14:11:23	warbo	do I also need a "library" section or something?
2015-03-09 14:11:40	Haskellfant	could you show us the complete cabal fiel
2015-03-09 14:11:40	warbo	I can get GHC to compile my Main module

2015-03-09 14:11:52	Haskellfant	and the nix files
2015-03-09 14:11:54	warbo	but then I just get the "hidden package" error when I *run* the resulting binary
2015-03-09 14:12:15	warbo	OK, I'll just check that they match up
2015-03-09 14:12:31	warbo	(I've switched between haskellPackages and haskellngPackages a few times trying to fix this)
2015-03-09 14:15:15	Haskellfant	sorry need to go, bbl

2015-03-09 14:18:53	warbo	that's with the "old style" Haskell infrastructure, a similar thing happens for HaskellNG but with different package names
2015-03-09 14:19:15	warbo	(same error, but ghcPaths is ghc-paths, etc.)
2015-03-09 14:19:19	Fuuzetsu	guess that makes the answer to ?<Fuuzetsu> are you running in a pure shell?? a ?no? and you should try that
2015-03-09 14:19:54	warbo	added "--pure" and the same error happens
2015-03-09 14:20:54	warbo	I've tried the answers from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26145383/ghc-package-is-hidden but they don't work either
2015-03-09 14:21:22	warbo	ghc-pkg expose doesn't like the read-only store, using "-package" argument to GHC just postpones the error until runtime

2015-03-09 14:25:05	warbo	for simplicity, that file is itself
2015-03-09 14:25:21	warbo	if I take away that function, and just "return ()", it loads and runs
2015-03-09 14:25:34	warbo	when I give "-package ghc-7.8.4"

2015-03-09 14:27:18	Fuuzetsu	I assume your file was compiling fine but then the GHC that was running internally, parsing the file didn't know where to find the packages
2015-03-09 14:27:24	Fuuzetsu	which is expected, you're meant to tell it all that in your program
2015-03-09 14:27:52	warbo	@Fuuzetsu yes, it looks like that's the case
2015-03-09 14:28:01	warbo	so half the time I was getting real GHC errors
2015-03-09 14:28:12	warbo	the other half I was getting errors from my program

2015-03-09 14:28:56	warbo	"cabal repl" also works, so I don't have to manually append "-package" arguments

2015-03-09 16:45:59	Fuuzetsu	IMHO 1. is better but it's a bit surprising to the user that --shel won't produce a nice usable shell file?

2015-03-09 16:48:36	jimstutt	I've been invoking nix-shell shell.nix which I got from somebody above this morning.
2015-03-09 16:49:08	Fuuzetsu	no need to specify shell.nix, it is the default
2015-03-09 16:49:25	Fuuzetsu	I mainly just copy my shell.nix around and modify per-project
2015-03-09 16:49:35	m0rphism	a third option might be to add a --build option, which generates a nix-expression compatible with nix-build, but this does seem a bit redundant to me ;)
2015-03-09 16:50:01	jimstutt	Fuzetsu: wouldn't option 1 patch cabal2nix-2.X to just have 'in pkg' and leave off the '.env'?
2015-03-09 16:50:15	Fuuzetsu	but the problem with that option is that it doesn't generate a reasonable file, where do we put the result? shell.nix? Seems strange.
2015-03-09 16:50:50	Fuuzetsu	jimstutt: not sure what you mean by ?in pkg? but yes it would just drop the .env

2015-03-09 16:51:57	jimstutt	'in pkg.env' is what I have to edit to 'in pkg' in my shell.nix
2015-03-09 16:52:14	m0rphism	If I understood the problem correctly, the file generated with --shell works for nix-shell but not for nix-build due to the .env postfix. My idea was, that in this case we could generate a third nix-expression build.nix which is used with nix-build. But I think your first option might be cleaner

2015-03-09 17:58:09	seanz	I get this error when trying to install povray - an error linking against the boost lib.
2015-03-09 17:58:24	Lethalman	seanz, I fixed that, you are not using a recent git nixpkgs I guess

2015-03-09 17:58:51	seanz	I thought I was. I'm using 14.12.
2015-03-09 17:59:22	ksf	(on the other hand, the longer I try to avoid compiling it with a single core the longer I'm going to have to wait overall)
2015-03-09 17:59:27	Lethalman	no 14.12 is stable
2015-03-09 17:59:33	Lethalman	but yes I can backport this change

2015-03-09 18:03:46	m0rphism	ksf: Have you added http://hydra.nixos.org/ http://hydra.cryp.to/ to your binary caches? haskellng is currently not build by the regular caches. But I noticed, too, that some packages are build even though I have the additional caches.
2015-03-09 18:03:54	ksf	oh.
2015-03-09 18:05:02	ksf	now did, still wants to build it.
2015-03-09 18:05:27	ksf	but I was referring to the "official" ghc builds on haskell.org/ghc
2015-03-09 18:05:31	m0rphism	ok then this question goes beyond my scope, I'm still new to nixos ;)

2015-03-10 10:23:13	arturdev2	wmertens: yes, I'll file an issue if I figure out what's happening. I'm a bit confused with fetchgit in general. Do I need to set sha256 hash?

2015-03-10 10:25:08	wmertens	arturdev2: the hash has to be the one of the result, so you need to fetch it first to know what it is. Uh... I think the URL has to be the https one, not sure.
2015-03-10 10:26:02	wmertens	so that would be https://bitbucket.org/ArturSoler/...
2015-03-10 10:26:24	arturdev2	wmertens: but then it can't use the SSH keys (it's a private repo)

2015-03-10 10:28:23	wmertens	ok, fetchgit just uses git to fetch, but you need to get those SSH keys into the build. Not trivial. Instead, use nix-prefetch-git

2015-03-10 11:35:13	Haskellfant	Lethalman: ah k, thx!
2015-03-10 11:35:37	Lethalman	it's a nodePackages issue
2015-03-10 11:35:46	wmertens_	viric: cool :) The wiki image didn't work so I'm building everything from scratch using bananian as a bootstrap base. Yes, over internet, maybe that's insane
2015-03-10 11:36:15	viric	I think so
2015-03-10 11:36:25	viric	master is quite updated to build most things.
2015-03-10 11:36:26	wmertens_	viric: or we can set up a hydra thing
2015-03-10 11:36:30	viric	I think that for nixos, only the boot is left.
2015-03-10 11:37:16	wmertens_	viric: meaning, if I use nixpkgs master and manually set up a boot loader, things Just Work (TM)?

2015-03-10 11:37:34	arturdev2	when using fetchgit (or fetchgitPrivate), what file should the sha256 hash represent?
2015-03-10 11:37:53	wmertens_	arturdev2: use nix-prefetch-git and it tells you the hash
2015-03-10 11:38:01	viric	wmertens_: nixos isn't far from setting up the bootloader
2015-03-10 11:38:11	viric	just the pi2 has some different things compared to the pi1, and has to beu pdated.
2015-03-10 11:38:14	Haskellfant	or just input the wrong one and wait for nix to tell you the correct hash :)
2015-03-10 11:39:12	arturdev2	Haskellfant: that's a good idea, thanks

It seems to me that the nixpkgs:trunk:unstable job referenced in the FAQ succeeded two days ago ( http://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixpkgs/trunk/unstable ). Hence I concluded from the FAQ that the new versions should be available soon, once they are transferred to the unstable cache. Am I misreading the FAQ?

2015-03-10 12:43:46	Lethalman	what do you want to achieve in the end... the real end

2015-03-10 12:44:04	viric	oh it's there
2015-03-10 12:44:07	Lethalman	viric, it's gnomeish yes
2015-03-10 12:44:16	Lethalman	a gtk app iirc
2015-03-10 12:44:21	seanz	Lethalman: I've got a python 2.6 application that specifies all needed python libraries in a requirements file. There's a fabric task for building the necessary environment.
2015-03-10 12:44:30	seanz	I'm trying to run the fabric command which builds the environment.
2015-03-10 12:44:42	viric	can be updated to 5.0
2015-03-10 12:44:44	Lethalman	seanz, is it something that can be built with python setup.py ?
2015-03-10 12:44:55	Lethalman	seanz, what app is that? is it open source somewhere?
2015-03-10 12:45:00	seanz	Not open source.
2015-03-10 12:45:05	seanz	The company
2015-03-10 12:45:12	seanz	The company's setup instructions use pip.
2015-03-10 12:45:34	seanz	pip install -r stable_req.txt
2015-03-10 12:46:00	seanz	The first hurdle I ran into was that I can't run that outside of a virtualenv because the nix store is readonly (I know that is by design).
2015-03-10 12:46:04	Lethalman	seanz, not sure this can be done with buildPythonPackage
2015-03-10 12:46:23	Lethalman	seanz, anyway, the first thing you must do, is creating a nix package for it
2015-03-10 12:46:31	Lethalman	you aren't going anywhere without first packaging something in nix
2015-03-10 12:46:35	seanz	Lethalman: For this app's requirements?
2015-03-10 12:47:06	seanz	This application also requires postgres, redis and rabbitmq. That's why I started up a container.
2015-03-10 12:47:12	seanz	Was that not the right approach, either?
2015-03-10 12:47:26	Lethalman	seanz, that's fine...
2015-03-10 12:47:31	Lethalman	but you first have to build the app
2015-03-10 12:47:41	Lethalman	it does require libraries for pgsql, redis and rabbitmq?
2015-03-10 12:47:47	seanz	Yes.
2015-03-10 12:47:51	Lethalman	so you must first package your app
2015-03-10 12:48:05	Lethalman	then put in your container a pgsql instance, a redis instance, rmq instance, and your package
2015-03-10 12:48:35	Lethalman	that's the workflow, or you will be having hard time composing stuff
2015-03-10 12:48:53	seanz	Ok, so that explains why things are not working for me.
2015-03-10 12:48:54	Lethalman	seanz, you must be able to nix-build your software, and run it with result/bin/app
2015-03-10 12:49:12	Lethalman	and it must just run (minus configuration and data of course)
2015-03-10 12:49:21	seanz	Lethalman: There are 5+ python Flask applications that result from this code base.
2015-03-10 12:49:31	seanz	We run them using python run_${app}.py
2015-03-10 12:49:36	seanz	Does that change anything?
2015-03-10 12:49:41	Lethalman	no that's fine
2015-03-10 12:49:44	seanz	Ok, good.
2015-03-10 12:49:57	seanz	So I need to create a package for the app's dependencies then.
2015-03-10 12:49:58	Lethalman	you will probably have all of thsoe run_...py under $out/result/bin/
2015-03-10 12:50:06	Lethalman	seanz, you create a package for the app
2015-03-10 12:50:23	Lethalman	the deps are probably already packaged
2015-03-10 12:50:45	seanz	Ok, but how does that change the way I would work with the app? I normally check out the code base, develop on it and then run the app from the code base in a virtualenv in order to test changes.
2015-03-10 12:50:49	seanz	Pretty standard process.

2015-03-10 12:51:08	Lethalman	seanz, you checkout the code base, do nix-shell and run the app
2015-03-10 12:51:18	Lethalman	no virtualenv involved
2015-03-10 12:51:34	seanz	Ok, so a default.nix should contain the packaging instructions.
2015-03-10 12:52:01	Lethalman	never used virtualenv in nix, so I don't know how painful it is btw

2015-03-10 12:52:06	azriphale	seanz: I am developing an app similar (on the surface) to you. I am using a virtualenv within a nix-shell. Here is my shell default.nix: https://gist.github.com/sjagoe/e2824d76afdd5b6cfecc
2015-03-10 12:52:23	seanz	azriphale: Thanks, I'll take a look.
2015-03-10 12:52:40	seanz	Lethalman: Is this the basic procedure you are recommending? https://nixos.org/wiki/Development_Environments#LIBRARY_PATH_Example:_Python_Environment_for_Installing_lxml_in_a_Virtualenv
2015-03-10 12:52:43	Lethalman	azriphale, I'm wondering why are you using virtualenv at all?
2015-03-10 12:52:44	seanz	Something like that?
2015-03-10 12:52:59	azriphale	I run that with "nix-instantiate /home/sjagoe/.shells/demo-shell.nix --indirect --add-root /home/sjagoe/.shells/demo-shell.drv"
2015-03-10 12:53:06	JagaJaga_	azriphale: why do you need virtualenv?
2015-03-10 12:53:08	Lethalman	seanz, no it's different, perhaps it's better if you follow the company using virtualenv
2015-03-10 12:53:13	azriphale	then "nix-shell /home/sjagoe/.shells/demo-shell.drv"
2015-03-10 12:53:14	Lethalman	maybe don't follow my advices
2015-03-10 12:53:30	azriphale	Lethalman: I'm using virtualenv because I set up nixos midweek while needed to continue working ;-)
2015-03-10 12:53:32	Lethalman	JagaJaga_, I think because of the company using virtualenv
2015-03-10 12:53:51	seanz	Lethalman: Ok, apologies for the burden. I want to make this work in NixOS, but obviously have to solve these issues first.
2015-03-10 12:53:53	Lethalman	but I guess one could avoid using that at all
2015-03-10 12:54:15	JagaJaga_	Lethalman: oh ,I see
2015-03-10 12:54:19	Lethalman	seanz, what are the requirements of your app other than flask, psycopg and...?
2015-03-10 12:54:46	azriphale	also, I deploy my app on ubuntu in our company's cloud services.
2015-03-10 12:54:53	seanz	Lethalman: One moment...gathering them. I should note that most work without issue.

2015-03-10 12:55:51	Lethalman	wow that's a lot
2015-03-10 12:55:55	seanz	Only some of these are failing due to unavailable source.
2015-03-10 12:56:06	Lethalman	yes I believe it's better you use virtualenv :)
2015-03-10 12:56:10	seanz	haha - ok.
2015-03-10 12:56:18	Lethalman	because of those strict == requirements
2015-03-10 12:56:25	Lethalman	understandable in your company
2015-03-10 12:56:36	seanz	Is that because it's too much to teach over IRC, or because it's not possible to do w/ a nix package?
2015-03-10 12:56:50	seanz	If it's the former, I'm inclined to continue figuring this out the "right way".
2015-03-10 12:56:57	Lethalman	seanz, it's that in nixpkgs we probably don't have those exact versions, so you'd have to package some of them to that exact version
2015-03-10 12:57:17	seanz	I see.
2015-03-10 12:57:27	Lethalman	let me find an example
2015-03-10 12:57:33	seanz	Lethalman: Thanks!
2015-03-10 12:57:42	Lethalman	for example simplejson is 3.3.0 in nixpkgs
2015-03-10 12:57:52	seanz	Lethalman: How did you find it?
2015-03-10 12:57:58	seanz	nix-env -qaP?
2015-03-10 12:58:09	Lethalman	seanz, https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/top-level/python-packages.nix
2015-03-10 12:58:49	Lethalman	then speaklater is 1.3, while you require 1.2

2015-03-10 12:59:34	Lethalman	so yes I'd use virtualenv to get the job done if I were you
2015-03-10 12:59:40	seanz	So the last hurdle I had was simplejson trying to use the python source code to build against. Is there an easy way to include that in my nix-shell?
2015-03-10 12:59:50	seanz	iElectric's advice got me 90% of the way there, it looked like.
2015-03-10 13:00:00	seanz	I appreciate your help to this point.
2015-03-10 13:00:01	Lethalman	seanz, what's the error output?

2015-03-10 13:03:12	Lethalman	it's a warning not an error

2015-03-10 13:04:03	seanz	So the python source was found for this extension without me specifying python26 in my nix-shell. python26 is installed in my container from the container's configuration.nix. That confuses me.
2015-03-10 13:04:11	seanz	What is isolated and what isn't?
2015-03-10 13:04:24	seanz	Should this be able to build without specifying python26 from the nix-shell?
2015-03-10 13:04:39	seanz	By the way, I'm still going through the nix pills. I can hold off on questions if the pills answer them.
2015-03-10 13:04:54	seanz	Maybe I'm just getting ahead of myself.
2015-03-10 13:06:22	Lethalman	seanz, try with nix-shell --pure
2015-03-10 13:12:14	seanz	Lethalman: I see. Yes, now it's behaving more like I expected. I probably don't want to use --pure then in this case.
2015-03-10 13:12:46	Lethalman	you want
2015-03-10 13:13:12	Lethalman	that python26 being found because it's installed it a consequence of some impurities we left in nixos for easeness of use
2015-03-10 13:13:26	Lethalman	some day I'm going to remove that /lib link being merged
2015-03-10 13:13:46	seanz	Then I'll need to pass in all deps to a nix-shell, I'm guessing.
2015-03-10 13:13:53	Lethalman	you are guessing right
2015-03-10 13:14:10	Lethalman	it's for your own sanity
2015-03-10 13:14:25	Lethalman	how would you nix-shell in an environment when python26 is not installed system-wide otherwise?
2015-03-10 13:14:31	Lethalman	it won't work
2015-03-10 13:14:39	seanz	I hear you - I'm going through the steep learning curve, but I'm sure the advantages will become obvious when I'm better w/ Nix.

2015-03-10 13:45:26	Lethalman	rzetterberg, so I believe the preseed process would be like this: instead of dropping in a login getty during installation, a script would run which does the installation
2015-03-10 13:45:50	Lethalman	the script should do very few things: 1) mount stuff under /mnt 2) copy/paste configuration.nix 3) nixos-install
2015-03-10 13:47:17	Lethalman	the other possible problem is that you may now want to download stuff from the network
2015-03-10 13:47:46	Lethalman	so there I think there's a way to force some packages into the installation /nix/store so that it doesn't get downloaded somehow

2015-03-10 17:42:34	offlinehacker	Lethalman: isn't there a way i can rebuild it atomically?
2015-03-10 17:42:44	Lethalman	offlinehacker, don't know any
2015-03-10 17:43:10	offlinehacker	so what i'm trying is testing deterministic builds, and i would like to rebuild store path twice and check if output hashes are the same

2015-03-10 17:49:49	qknight	offlinehacker: you can force a rebuild by using no channel: 'nix-channel list', then remove it

2015-03-10 17:50:27	offlinehacker	qknight: but this won't work i gues if path is already in a store?
2015-03-10 17:50:32	qknight	offlinehacker: however, that would be for new stuff you do, if you want to rebuild a already installed set of packages you need another command
2015-03-10 17:50:43	offlinehacker	yes
2015-03-10 17:51:02	offlinehacker	any idea here? i would not like to delete path, because it could be a system library
2015-03-10 17:51:08	offlinehacker	that's in use
2015-03-10 17:51:31	offlinehacker	could i do a repair or something?
