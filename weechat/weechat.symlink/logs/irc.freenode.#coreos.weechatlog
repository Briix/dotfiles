2015-01-19 23:45:48	SirFunk	probably 10s, but i'd like to keep as small of a VM as I can
2015-01-19 23:46:16	SirFunk	Although the memory usage does seem pretty low. I'll try seperate containers running nginx for now
2015-01-19 23:46:21	-->	doniphon (~doniphon@foresight/developer/doniphon) has joined #coreos
2015-01-19 23:47:19	hvolpers	SirFunk: keeping both on the same machine can be done using sidekicks, however, you would have to restart the nginx container to update the volumes (AFAIK)
2015-01-19 23:47:51	SirFunk	hvolpers: volumes can point at locations in the filesystem, not talking about "data containers"
2015-01-19 23:48:06	SirFunk	i was just thinking of throwing them in /data/static/site_name or something
2015-01-19 23:48:18	SirFunk	I would have to restart nginx every time I added a site though
2015-01-19 23:48:20	hvolpers	SirFunk: sure, but this way you would have to take care of the data distribution manually
2015-01-19 23:48:31	hvolpers	SirFunk: in both cases, yes
2015-01-19 23:49:23	SirFunk	oh, using a container just for the data and mounting that as a volume in another container, that isn't a bad idea....

2015-01-20 00:49:53	brendan6	hvolpers: Yes, that's the weird thing. The individual units work fine (even if I add the deps) with systemd.  The mount just won't run as soon as it is started with fleetctl
2015-01-20 00:50:50	hvolpers	brendan6: mh, any entry in logfiles? mount should work with fleet

2015-02-07 17:39:36	hydrajump	hi the AWS Loft half-day workshop on CoreOS next week will it be streamed? I'd like to attend remotely.
2015-02-07 17:41:34	codey	I have a question about CoreOS and service
2015-02-07 17:41:38	codey	services*
2015-02-07 17:42:29	codey	is there a way to have the flannel overlay network accessible directly from outside the coreos environment? If not, how do you run services in containers with coreos that might need to be NAT translated to public addresses?
2015-02-07 17:43:06	codey	You can't just portmap to the host it's on and PAT that way because the point of coreos is for a container to be able to reappear on any node

2015-02-07 20:18:10	philips	nir: in that case you would simply provide the binaries to the program in the containers and not the code
2015-02-07 20:18:34	ianblenke	that isn't a problem that linux containers are currently trying to solve. that's more of a DRM thing.
2015-02-07 20:18:36	philips	nir: if you have a interpreted language like python, ruby, or js you need to take some sort of step to obscure it even in a container
2015-02-07 20:19:34	nir	i would if the code were written in golang or c, but it's ruby and i think it's to much hassle ..

2015-02-07 20:20:37	ianblenke	the closest thing I remember seeing for that would be something like crate, presented back at rubycon 2008

2015-02-07 20:21:21	nir	gem is too old
2015-02-07 20:21:21	ianblenke	essentially, he packaged up the ruby source in a sqlite database, and then made a wrapper that would unpack it via evaling it at runtime.

2015-02-07 20:23:45	ianblenke	you could aways just opensource it.

2015-02-07 21:54:06	mgoelzer	ashp:  so you would be using mesos to manage the cluster in lieu of fleetctl and similar tools in coreos?  what do you see as the benefit of using coreos in this case instead of, say, some generic linux distro (ubuntu, etc.)
2015-02-07 21:54:56	ashp	mgoelzer: I think mesos would only be used for certain things (like spark, etc) and I'd carry on using coreos for lower level/simple things that don't need such complex orchestration/management.
2015-02-07 21:55:26	ashp	I mean maybe it's feasible to just run spark in a cluster without even having mesos, but I was unclear on how possible that is, I'm new to mesos/spark/hadoop so it's all a bit murky.
2015-02-07 21:55:29	mgoelzer	ok, i see what you mean.  (i'm not that familiar with mesos)
2015-02-07 21:55:42	ashp	Also really it just comes down to my boss wanted mesos and I want coreos and mesos has a "run mesos on coreos!" guide
2015-02-07 21:55:49	ashp	so it feels like they feel at least that running mesos on coreos is sensible
2015-02-07 21:56:15	mgoelzer	ha ha, yeah, i've been in situations like that :-)

The etcd discovery url will have two entries with machine-id A and B, both for the same IP

2015-02-09 13:34:49	Nightling	disaster37, yes, coreos instances are meant to be volatile like that
2015-02-09 13:35:28	mozg	i am starting the first coreos server with the server's network ip address for both addr and peer-addr. Like this addr: 10.0.1.45:4001 and peer-addr: 10.0.0.1.45:7001
2015-02-09 13:35:51	mozg	etcd starts okay and I can see in journalctl -u etcd that the host has joined the cluster
2015-02-09 13:36:15	mozg	I do the same for other coreos servers, but I only change the peer-addr to reflect the coreos network ip address
2015-02-09 13:36:24	mozg	i can see in the logs that all coreos servers join the cluster

2015-02-09 19:47:49	lordelph	@rw7891 I?ve done something similar recently, but using nginx instead of haproxy. Same principle applies though - the backend servers announce themselves to etcd, and you have something like confd watching etcd and updating the load balancer confguration. http://blog.dixo.net/2015/02/load-balancing-with-coreos/

2015-02-09 21:03:22	rw7891	Hmm ok. Basically, i'm following a tutorial to setup HAProxy on a few machines with apache. The line in the tutorial to get the machine IP, curl -sw "\n" http://169.254.169.254/metadata/v1/interfaces/private/0/ipv4/address, does not work on my machien because I do not have that metadata structure setup.
2015-02-09 21:03:39	rw7891	This tutorial is for DigitalOcean, however i'm adapting it for in house cluster deployments.
2015-02-09 21:04:09	rw7891	My assumption is I need to recreate that metatdata key as shown above but i'm not enterly sure how to do that.

2015-02-10 13:56:31	hkjn	heya, I am having issues with etcd.SetCluster() on CoreOS (etcd v.0.4.6) - I've traced it to this line doing GET [etcd peer]/v2/members: https://github.com/coreos/go-etcd/blob/master/etcd/client.go#L301
2015-02-10 13:56:46	hkjn	and `curl -L http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/members` indeed gives 404 directly in the CoreOS host

2015-02-10 13:57:56	penzur	cluster not set properly?
2015-02-10 13:58:58	hkjn	penzur: it is as far as I can tell; I can set values in etcd, use fleet &c

2015-02-10 22:35:53	rw7891	mazzy: right. That's because there isn't quorum anymore. It fails because majority is less than two. By setting a token to size of two, you're saying that you can lose one machine and be okay at one machine. This is not the recomended approach but I ran into this because I thought I only needed to test with two machines. Once I used a key of size two, my cluster worked and I could add additional machines as needed without troubleshooting a quorum problem anym

2015-02-10 23:56:12	jcj_moz	Howdy, all! What?s the generally accepted way to ship openssh access logs to a syslog server (Logstash) from a CoreOS box? I?m familiar with getting docker container logs out (using progrium/logspout for the purpose) but that doesn?t directly involve systemd, where openssh is logging by default.

2015-02-11 01:32:11	chance	and all that data is already in etcd, via registrator. you just have to extract the stuff you need from the json. and confd would be a good way to autoconfigure HAProxy.

2015-02-11 01:32:47	chance	but what's niec is you can just use dns. and if IP's change, that's fine, you dont have to worry because your other services are using dns, and the IP will just change beneath the hood

2015-02-11 01:39:05	rw7891	would that still be true if we just wanted this for use on our internal network where maybe 100 computers would hit it looking for DNS recrods?

2015-02-11 01:39:52	chance	i dont really know. i mostly use this for internal dns, not external
2015-02-11 01:40:05	chance	are those 100 computers part of your cluster?

2015-02-11 01:40:21	rw7891	it would be for internal DNS
2015-02-11 01:40:30	chance	because ideally, every node in the cluster just runs skydns, and every service just queries its own local dns server
2015-02-11 01:40:31	rw7891	nope, they are individual workstations
2015-02-11 01:40:51	chance	skydns imo is purely service discovery
2015-02-11 01:41:02	rw7891	right, which is okay
2015-02-11 01:41:08	rw7891	(i guess)
2015-02-11 01:41:11	chance	so its entirely for your services to discover eachother, not for external workstations to use

2015-02-11 01:41:46	rw7891	my cluster would use skydns to discover eachother while running BIND to provide DNS services for the 100 workstations in the company
2015-02-11 01:41:50	chance	if you want your workstations to have dns records to some service in your cluster, i would set up a load balancer + dns server for those to hit, which then routes to your applications in the cluster.
2015-02-11 01:42:01	chance	yeah, something like that
2015-02-11 01:42:18	chance	also, while on the topic of cool etcd-backed applications

2015-02-11 01:42:43	chance	vulcand, is a load balancer which uses etcd for it's backend. it might be useful if HAProxy becomes difficult to use. i dont know how well it would inter-op with skydns though.

2015-02-11 01:43:45	chance	lots of options. many unproven, but just as often, they work well (enough)
2015-02-11 01:43:49	chance	sure.
2015-02-11 01:44:03	chance	i need to write docs for that repo, its mostly my dev environment. but i have other using it.
2015-02-11 01:44:09	chance	mostly with coreos-vagrant
2015-02-11 01:44:36	rw7891	no worries, i'll keep that in mind. thanks again for all your help today.

2015-02-11 13:06:42	m42u	Hi guys, I would like to know if it's possible, in my Unit file, to check if my container already exists and start it (docker start my-container) instead of run it (docker run my-container). I'm maybe wrong in the way of doing it...
2015-02-11 13:07:22	m42u	I want to keep all the data I've got in my container

2015-02-11 13:10:25	magnars	keeping data is usually done by binding volumes from the host into the container, but how you handle that on CoreOS is still a mystery to me, since the container can start on any machine.

2015-02-12 18:19:11	jimjim	so the service only sets the values if I run it central service part of the cluster
2015-02-12 18:20:12	+robszumski	jimjim: id guess that the etcdctl call in the service isn't picking up the env vars correctly from cloud-config. it works on the central machine because that one doesn't require the env var
2015-02-12 18:20:32	jimjim	correction it should of course be "etcdctl set /test test_value"
2015-02-12 18:20:41	+robszumski	the good news is that all of that crap can go away once etcd 2.0 ships in the image and you can use proxy mode

2015-02-13 00:46:38	RobertLabrie	Is there any way to edit /usr/share/oem/cloud-config.yml from inside the toolbox? I'm playing with a sandbox trying to get a cloud-config I like, and I throughly dislike vim (I've got nano inside the toolbox). When I enter toolbox, /usr/share/oem is empty and it looks like the volume /dev/sda6 which is mounted to /usr/share/oem in coreos, it not mounted or even available to mount. Thanks.

2015-02-13 10:17:59	grimtech	thanks balboah
2015-02-13 10:18:52	balboah	yeah I?m also replacing etcd to run my own proxy until 2.0 is in stable :)

2015-02-13 10:27:15	balboah	grimtech: it?s easy to loose quorum in the case of auto scalng. So I run the default etcd in a ?core? group that doesn?t scale down in other cases than system failure. And the others proxy to that cluster without involving 3rd party discovery service and can happily scale up and down without messing with it.

2015-02-13 17:26:39	red_beard	is it a useful IP on either of those?
2015-02-13 17:27:01	cetex	it's a quite serious limitation. there are two major things that makes us look at coreos over ubuntu, one is that it has everything docker-related working on ramdisk, the other is that it has fleet.
2015-02-13 17:27:02	red_beard	this is somewhat a problem of cloud-config and not etcd

2015-02-13 17:27:44	red_beard	so i'm trying to remember what i did with one of our customers
2015-02-13 17:28:00	cetex	we're currently running ubuntu, managed by salt, on top of that we run mesos & aurora, and a few other things.
2015-02-13 17:28:01	red_beard	so their environment is 75k machines all PXE booting
2015-02-13 17:28:35	red_beard	and that's where the asking for ip of interface originally came up
2015-02-13 17:28:49	red_beard	so it's really though just the advertising name
2015-02-13 17:28:57	cetex	yeah.
2015-02-13 17:29:00	red_beard	which, even a hostname (i would think) should be fine

2015-02-13 17:29:08	cetex	we can work with hostname :)
2015-02-13 17:29:14	cetex	although, ip should be enough.
2015-02-13 17:29:34	red_beard	well, hostname is consumable as a variable
2015-02-13 17:29:41	cetex	each machine gets a fqdn from dhcp, so that's what etcd should use
2015-02-13 17:29:45	red_beard	the IPs actually aren't
2015-02-13 17:30:13	cetex	but it seems that systemd-networkd is hijacking the interfaces, or if it's udev. i can't get bonding up and running.
2015-02-13 17:30:27	cetex	and i can't find dhcpcd, dhclient or anything like that running
2015-02-13 17:30:34	red_beard	ahhh
2015-02-13 17:30:35	cetex	so maybe hostname isn't properly set either.
2015-02-13 17:30:36	red_beard	so
2015-02-13 17:30:46	red_beard	networkd (as by it's design) never tears down an IP
2015-02-13 17:30:51	red_beard	it's _REALLY_ annoying
2015-02-13 17:30:56	red_beard	it's only additive

2015-02-13 17:31:45	red_beard	barakmich: the previous makeup of the team 1) didn't understand the problem 2) didn't think it was important

2015-02-13 17:32:05	cetex	red_beard: well, it isn't in our current environment. we have our own image running and it has a config applied that set's up bonding then starts dhclient on the bonding interface.

2015-02-13 17:32:45	cetex	;)
2015-02-13 17:32:48	cetex	yeah.
2015-02-13 17:32:50	red_beard	TOO MANY USERS
2015-02-13 17:32:55	red_beard	good problem to have
2015-02-13 17:33:06	red_beard	so you've already seen those snippets
2015-02-13 17:33:18	cetex	we also have dhcp option-82 running, so each machine will be assigned one, and only one ip, no matter what interface it requests it from.
2015-02-13 17:33:27	cetex	this makes it possible for us to use dhcp and still have static hostnames.
2015-02-13 17:33:38	cetex	even if we replace a blade-server.
2015-02-13 17:33:49	cetex	as long as it's on the same switchport it gets the same config.
2015-02-13 17:34:31	cetex	we have an issue that the servers upon boot configures any interface with a link-up to get an ip, so both interfaces get the same ip, even though we set it to use bonding in the cloud-config.
2015-02-13 17:34:31	red_beard	got it, in my stuff in a previous life i allowed updates to DNS based on a kerberos host ticket
2015-02-13 17:34:53	cetex	:)
2015-02-13 17:35:18	cetex	and after it has an ip set networkd refuses to configure anything.

2015-02-13 17:35:35	red_beard	certainly sounds like a usability bug in networkd
2015-02-13 17:35:48	red_beard	question: can you file one and let me know the number?
2015-02-13 17:35:51	red_beard	or

2015-02-13 17:37:36	cetex	I guess there once upon a time was network configuration documentation not relying on networkd
2015-02-13 17:38:08	cetex	so if i rebake the image and disable networkd, then configure networking the old-school way i'll probably be able to solve it.

2015-02-13 17:38:55	red_beard	yeah.  i mean even networkd is just using the same things that "ip addr" type commands are doing
2015-02-13 17:39:28	cetex	yeah. the question is, is it networkd that's setting up dhcp ip's on the interfaces?
2015-02-13 17:39:33	cetex	or bringing them up?
2015-02-13 17:39:36	cetex	or is it udev?
2015-02-13 17:39:38	cetex	or something
2015-02-13 17:40:34	cetex	if we're to automate this and get a nice and repeatable pattern we need interfaces to be down, no ip assigned until after we've setup bonding.

2015-02-13 17:44:48	cetex	randomly (seems like a race condition) it sets up one interface in the bond, but rarely both.
2015-02-13 17:44:54	cetex	and sometimes no interfaces are in it.
2015-02-13 17:45:26	cetex	but if we can kill networkd and configure it manually somehow i'd be happy. we have a very static setup today and it works very very well.

2015-02-14 02:03:19	HashNuke	From what I've read I love the fact that there's no daemon to run for rocket.

2015-02-15 19:48:53	PeteNete	I booted a coreos image via virtualbox and my goal is to ship a docker container to the virtualbox machine. I don't know what to do now but I'm stuck. Can anyone give me a pointer what to do next? Thanks. (I think I'm stuck registering the vm to my etcd registry)

2015-02-15 19:57:20	hydrajump	when you create a container using rocket you don't specify what OS base image to use, right?
2015-02-15 19:58:58	hydrajump	does that mean that recent vulnerabilities such as shellshock and ghost that required you to rebuild all your docker containers to update the base image OS, e.g. ubuntu would not have been required if those containers where created using rocket?

2015-02-16 13:04:01	robj_	Hi everyone - is anyone around that has some experience running coreos in an AWS Autoscaling Group? I?m finding that our instances keep cycling - i.e. something, though I?m not quite sure what, is terminating instances, to which the ASG is responding by bringing up replacement instances. I?ve tried setting reboot-strategy: off, but to no avail. Anyone have any other ideas, or is it not recommended to have such a setup?

2015-02-16 20:32:07	guruvan	that's what you'd hope, but fleet/fleetctl went dead, and a curl https://ip.address:7001/v2/admin/machines worked, but the leader still listed - attempts to delete we met with what looks like a redirect ///to the leader's IP!/// and, ofc that was a no go
2015-02-16 20:32:42	guruvan	the problem wasa that the node needing replacement was the leader, and we needed to force an election
2015-02-16 20:33:00	Robert_Labrie	robszumski no way to do it before 2.0? I know when the first node starts for the first time, it declares itself master
2015-02-16 20:33:29	chance	guruvan: the election happens when the internal raft timer times-out trying to heartbeat to the leader
2015-02-16 20:33:39	chance	which should only be a second or 2 at most i believe
2015-02-16 20:33:42	guruvan	apparently not

2015-02-16 22:27:56	@robszumski	mozg: it looks like there is already a cloudstack OEM, so someone's already figured it all out: https://github.com/coreos/coreos-overlay/blob/master/coreos-base/oem-cloudstack/files/cloud-config.yml
2015-02-16 22:29:30	mozg	robszumski, yes indeed. This is exactly what I am using. There is also a ready template for Cloudstack which one can use. However, the cloud-config example is limited to getting the ssh keys across.

2015-02-16 22:29:52	mozg	this part is working perfectly well and I can successfully log in with SSH keys provisied via CloudStack
2015-02-16 22:30:16	mozg	I am interested in taking this a step further and using the user_data bit, which can be stored in cloudstack
2015-02-16 22:30:36	mozg	I think DigitalOcean is using this in their tutorials and I would like to get something like that working as well.

2015-02-16 22:31:29	mozg	so far, i've succeeded in supplying the exact copy of my custom cloud-config to the user_data and it can be downloaded from the cloudstack's virtual router (dhcp server, etc)
2015-02-16 22:31:40	mozg	so the coreos can grab this and use it.
2015-02-16 22:31:50	mozg	i can see that it is trying to in the journal
2015-02-16 22:31:57	mozg	however, something is not working as it should
2015-02-16 22:32:24	mozg	basically, my example of cloud-config just adds a few lines to start etcd and fleetd

2015-02-16 22:32:49	mozg	and it is identical to the one listed in /usr/share/oem/cloud-config.yml
2015-02-16 22:33:13	mozg	however, when the user_data is used to start the vm, I do not have a successfull start of etcd and fleetd
2015-02-16 22:33:42	mozg	but if I start a vm without supplying user_data the services are started perfectly well
2015-02-16 22:33:54	mozg	so, it seems there is some sort of conflict
2015-02-16 22:34:21	mozg	i have tried to completely remove the /usr/share/oem/cloud-config.yml and rely on user_data, but I do not see much happening
2015-02-16 22:34:34	mozg	so, at the moment I am unsure where the problem is

2015-02-17 12:34:04	balboah	magnars: for example on Amazon you could move the EBS volume. Or you setup replication on the database itself and let it worry about copying things. But of course starting up a clean db will take time to re-sync. You could also have a local volume mount so that restaring the container doesn?t wipe everything

2015-02-17 12:36:05	balboah	another approach is to do regular backup dumps and automatic restore in case it starts up with empty data
2015-02-17 12:36:24	magnars	balboah: these all sound like I'm manually choosing which machines the db-container is running on - or am I supposed to set up some automated EBS volume move every time the container is restarted?

2015-02-17 12:39:11	magnars	I see, so the solution is really to have multiple database containers running at a time, and letting them sync
2015-02-17 12:39:20	balboah	something like a website on top of nginx wouldn?t need to do that and is easier to manage like that

2015-02-17 12:43:02	magnars	so my take away is that running your own database on CoreOS is painful, since it doesn't have first class support for volumes, and you should probably outsource that to AWS or some such.
2015-02-17 12:43:53	balboah	outsource as much as possible generally that isn?t your core business ;)
2015-02-17 12:44:00	magnars	indeed

2015-02-17 14:44:45	Robert_Labrie	right that's kind of what I'm wondering, if I roll my own and have a unit run a script to populate it, is there any hope if it getting pulled back in?

2015-02-17 14:48:35	guruvan	we do that with all our DNS announcers for example - we write several /etc/something.env files in various units, and then have information like DC/region/zone and other data available to construct DNS data for service discovery
2015-02-17 14:48:48	brendanjerwin	You should also be able to do `After=network-online.target` to only run the unit after you have the network up. Rather than loop.

I have even gone the route of copying docker-early.service and hand adding the --iface=eth1 to support my setup (2 nics where I want traffic on the 2nd). But no matter what, I can't seem to get containers on separate hosts to work. Has anyone been able to get this working in a vagrant setup currently?

2015-02-17 19:27:16	rw78911	zimboboyd: I think I know what's up. If you boot to ramdisk and you're joining the fleet at that point, what I saw in my setup is that if there were any failures to join fleet that ended up in my machine being added to the fleet using incorrect data (IP address, etc), then that machine could not rejoin the fleet since a ramdisk is transitory - each boot will give you a different UUID of the machine. What I did was delay the fleet join until I install CoreOS

2015-02-17 19:42:24	HexGhost	so I'm trying to install it. it looks like the process is, i turn the coreOS image into an OVF file. then i have to make a text config file
2015-02-17 19:42:34	HexGhost	make an ISO out of that config file, and then mount it along with the OVF and start it up?
2015-02-17 19:42:41	@robszumski	zimboboyd: each time you start or stop on of those PXE machines, doesn't your quorum get lower and lower until the cluster fails? or are you scripting the machine removal API? i think it might be better for oyu to run somethign that looks more like https://coreos.com/docs/cluster-management/setup/cluster-architectures/#easy-development/testing-cluster
2015-02-17 19:42:41	HexGhost	and the config file has stuff like the network settings?

2015-02-17 19:45:13	zimboboyd	HexGhost: We tried also with the ISO (cloudconfig) first but we did not suceed in setting the IP this way
2015-02-17 19:45:18	zimboboyd	We used DHCP then
2015-02-17 19:45:20	HexGhost	oh
2015-02-17 19:45:22	HexGhost	hmmm

2015-02-17 19:45:31	rw78911	HexGhost: host that config file on a webserver that can be hit from the machines you're brining up.
2015-02-17 19:45:37	rw78911	the yml file(s)
2015-02-17 19:45:53	rw78911	this allows you to tweak the files in one location
2015-02-17 19:45:55	HexGhost	hm
2015-02-17 19:46:00	HexGhost	but how do i set network stuff then
2015-02-17 19:46:20	zimboboyd	But now we set up a dhcp/iPXE server where the other coreos machines boot from, and the settings come from there (all on ESXi)
2015-02-17 19:46:41	HexGhost	ok
2015-02-17 19:46:48	HexGhost	so sounds like its easier for me to do dhcp on the nodes

2015-02-17 19:47:01	rw78911	Yes
2015-02-17 19:47:04	HexGhost	ok
2015-02-17 19:47:08	zimboboyd	But like rw78911 says, you can boot once, and install coreos to a disk on the vmware

2015-02-17 19:47:51	HexGhost	i guess we don't use dhcp in the dc
2015-02-17 19:49:04	rw78911	HexGhost: If i'm not mistaken, the ESXi host is what determines the network range that is presented to the guest machines. If that's the case (you should verify that), then simply having your PXE server on the same subnet as the ESXi host will "present" the PXE boot to your guests and allow them to grab an IP address from DHCP.

2015-02-17 19:53:38	zimboboyd	HexGhost: Thats why i decided to boot from dhcp/pxe then i can and nodes as i want. The cloud-config reside on the PXE server. Maybe the cloudconfigs can also be server by a webserver (With some scripting logic)
2015-02-17 19:53:40	@robszumski	FWIW, the requirement to make a config-drive comes form vmware's lack of a way to provide user-data in another way, its absolutely not ideal

2015-02-18 18:34:28	rw78911	_andyj_: From a novice perspective, could it be that the call to restart iptables happens before you write the iptables config?
2015-02-18 18:35:02	rw78911	_andyj_:  This is purly speculative, since your config looks fine otherwise, what happens if you move the writefiles section above the coreos section.

2015-02-18 19:32:46	rw78911	robszumski: for whenever you are back, and anyone who also might have an idea: in this tutorial on remote fleet access (https://coreos.com/docs/launching-containers/launching/fleet-using-the-client/#remote-fleet-access), it assumes the user I am running the "ssh-add" command as on my laptop is the same user we have on each of the cluster machines. This is not the case since we do not store admin credentials as a user and pub key on our team members laptops. 
2015-02-18 19:32:59	rw78911	I hope this is making sense. I'm happy to clarify if need be.

2015-02-18 19:51:31	_andyj_	I don't understand the question, if you have ssh access to the coreos host and proper permissions on server you call fleet on the coreos host...  that fleet tunnel is so you can run fleet local and control your host without having to first ssh to the host I believe
2015-02-18 19:53:28	_andyj_	you could setup an alias locally to send all "fleet" commands through an ssh tunnel to your cluster if that's what your wanting

2015-02-18 19:56:48	rw78911	_andyj_:  Sorry about that, i'll try and rephrase. I only found out about fleet tunnel this morning. Previously, to check the status of a unit, we would run "sudo fleetctl list-units" to find the machine running the service then logout of the fleet box we were just on, log into the fleet box that is running our service in order to view it's proper status.
2015-02-18 19:57:31	rw78911	_andyj_: As you can see, it's a lot of leg work. We do this because running "sudo fleetctl status myservice" always failed with the SSH_AUTH_SOCK error.

2015-02-18 21:53:02	Robert_Labrie	yeah, but ... instead of deploying the OFV 3 times, I deployed it once and cloned
2015-02-18 21:53:24	chance	i think its there's potentially a lot of other potentially wrong things by not letting it start up
2015-02-18 21:53:38	chance	err by using a copy
2015-02-18 21:53:40	Robert_Labrie	so to bootstrap I need another disk with my cloud-config on it right?

2015-02-18 21:55:47	Robert_Labrie	I guess the big bummer is $private_ipv4 isn't available for vmware, so I end up having to have a unique cloud-config.yml for every node
2015-02-18 21:56:04	Robert_Labrie	with a bunch of IPs explicitly listed for like peer and peer-addr, etc
2015-02-18 21:56:08	chance	its available on vmware fusion.
2015-02-18 21:56:16	Robert_Labrie	ESXi 5.1 here...
2015-02-18 21:56:37	Robert_Labrie	the VMWare RPC mechanism is a poorly documented black box
2015-02-18 21:56:44	Robert_Labrie	I'm sure you can extract the IP, but I don't know how
2015-02-18 21:56:56	chance	ah im reading that in the coreos docs
2015-02-18 21:57:05	chance	not available :\
2015-02-18 21:57:15	kiteless	You?d have to query the vSphere server

2015-02-18 21:57:45	Robert_Labrie	kiteless you can query vsphere from inside the guest using XMLRPC if you have creds to hit the endpoint
2015-02-18 21:58:11	rw78911	Shouldn't ?tunnel work when all machines have the same pubkey file?
2015-02-18 21:58:18	rw78911	and the same username
2015-02-18 21:58:29	Robert_Labrie	they also have an RPC tool to pass data from the guest <---> host but they dont tell ppl how to use it
2015-02-18 21:58:47	chance	ew really? what makes it worth it then?

2015-02-18 22:00:22	chance	because you can use systemd + dhcp for some nice things, so it might be nice to have cloud-config setup before that
2015-02-18 22:00:49	Robert_Labrie	chance re: vmware, TBH I don't know. I do it at work, there is a namespace, guestinfo.* that you can add custom keys to, then pull them out with the vmware toolbox, but I'm sure there are other things to pass because vcenter is aware of the guest IPs even if they can't talk to it over HTTPS

2015-02-18 22:01:42	Robert_Labrie	yeah I could mount the vmdk somewhere and drop in the cloud-config, better to use the disk I think though at that point
2015-02-18 22:01:50	kiteless	Is there an easy way to configure and mount a drive partition if it isn?t already formatted, but simply to mount it if it is?

2015-02-18 22:02:41	chance	for cloud-config

2015-02-19 10:40:07	cetex	it seems to be insanely stupid at the moment. one proxy and one server running, proxy connects to server, can communicate, then server happily announces that it's on localhost, client tries and fails.
